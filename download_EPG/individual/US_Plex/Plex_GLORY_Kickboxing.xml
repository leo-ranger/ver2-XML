    <desc>GLORY Kickboxing’s Summer of GLORY concluded with a massive event from the Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam. In the night’s headliner, heavyweight champion Rico Verhoeven took on Brazilian challenger Guto Inocente. Verhoeven had defended his belt seven straight times since capturing the title in 2014. His winning streak inside the GLORY ring stood at 16. Inocente looked to dethrone the world’s top-ranked heavyweight riding the momentum of wins over Benjamin Adegbuyi, D’Angelo Marshall and Hesdy Gerges. Gold was also on the line in the co-main event, as longtime featherweight titleholder Robin van Roosmalen rematched interim champion Petchpanomrung Kiatmookao. The pair met previously at GLORY 41 — also in van Roosmalen’s home country of Holland — with the Dutchman taking home a controversial, majority-decision victory.</desc>
