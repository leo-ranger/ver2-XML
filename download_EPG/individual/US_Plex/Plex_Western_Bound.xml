    <desc>Now down to ten cowboys, the competition continues with an all-new immunity challenge that focuses on a whole different aspect of cowboyin' - business acumen. The contestants must prove they know the cattle market by estimating the value of various livestock at auction. Trace asks the contestants to continue to train the colts from the last elimination challenge, but they struggle to develop a plan that will work for everyone. The elimination challenge tests the contestants' team strategy, roping, and speed. Each team has forty-five minutes to collect fifteen gold ear tags from mixed herds in two different pastures. Frustrations build when the green team has trouble with the pens, and a cow escapes during the blue team's run. As the competition intensifies, one cowboy tries to get rid of his biggest competition. Unimpressed by how the teams handled the challenge, Trace shakes things up by sending two cowboys home.</desc>
