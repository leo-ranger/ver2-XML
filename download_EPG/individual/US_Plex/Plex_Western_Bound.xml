    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E05</episode-num>
    <desc>With only four cowboys left, Trace raises the stakes by taking away the chance to win immunity from elimination. At this point, one mistake can cost any of them the competition. A series of challenges test the remaining contestants on their mastery of essential cowboy skills: horsemanship, roping, and cattle handling. One of the top competitors delivers less-than-perfect results for the first time and misses the mark during a steer-roping challenge. When tending to the cattle, two of the contestants' lack of experience comes to light, putting the health of the herd at risk. One of the competitors uses his experience as a cow boss and takes control of the group challenge. The other cowboys question his direction, unsure if his tactics will be successful. Trace makes a tough decision and sends someone packing.</desc>
