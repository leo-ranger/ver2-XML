    <desc>It's time for the cowboys to ride into new pastures as they explore growing their cattle business in unexpected ways. Bubba has been making good money working for his father-in-law's company in Mississippi, but he realizes he'd rather be out of his office chair and back on his horse in Alabama. Cody is excited to be managing a big rodeo, but a steer mishap puts the future of his contract on the ropes. And, even though Booger has happily saddled up with Jaclyn, it's unfamiliar terrain for him when she starts adding a woman's touch to his bachelor pad. As the three cowboys get together to sort yearlings for a friend, they devise a plan for making BBQ sauce to expand their cooking skills and company.</desc>

    <desc>With only four cowboys left, Trace raises the stakes by taking away the chance to win immunity from elimination. At this point, one mistake can cost any of them the competition. A series of challenges test the remaining contestants on their mastery of essential cowboy skills: horsemanship, roping, and cattle handling. One of the top competitors delivers less-than-perfect results for the first time and misses the mark during a steer-roping challenge. When tending to the cattle, two of the contestants' lack of experience comes to light, putting the health of the herd at risk. One of the competitors uses his experience as a cow boss and takes control of the group challenge. The other cowboys question his direction, unsure if his tactics will be successful. Trace makes a tough decision and sends someone packing.</desc>

The stress of maintaining a long-distance relationship leads Bubba and Kaley to move back to Alabama for good. Booger embraces his new role as a family man and enlists young Matthew to help surprise Jaclyn with a much needed home-improvement project. Cody helps Misty throw a beef-tasting party for potential buyers. As the guys ponder using their cowboy skills to open a steak house, they decide to get some on-the-job training by working a shift during the hectic dinner rush at a local eatery.</desc>

    <desc>The three remaining cowboys go head-to-head in a dramatic final showdown to prove they have more heart, grit, and cowboy skills than their fellow competitors. In the arena, the cowboys are tested individually on roping and reining. The extremely technical challenge puts the contestants on edge. An impressive performance by one of the competitors sets the bar high for the rest of the cowboys. Out in the field, the contestants have to work together as a team in their last challenge. The cowboys must successfully drive a herd through a grueling three-mile journey of pastures and pines, navigating multiple obstacles throughout the way. Feeling the pressure to win, bad communication puts the herd in a dangerous situation when a group of their cattle wanders onto a busy road. Trace spends one-on-one time with the remaining cowboys, evaluates their performances throughout the competition, and names the first-ever winner of the Ultimate Cowboy Showdown.</desc>
