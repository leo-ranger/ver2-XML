    <desc>Now down to ten cowboys, the competition continues with an all-new immunity challenge that focuses on a whole different aspect of cowboyin' - business acumen. The contestants must prove they know the cattle market by estimating the value of various livestock at auction. Trace asks the contestants to continue to train the colts from the last elimination challenge, but they struggle to develop a plan that will work for everyone. The elimination challenge tests the contestants' team strategy, roping, and speed. Each team has forty-five minutes to collect fifteen gold ear tags from mixed herds in two different pastures. Frustrations build when the green team has trouble with the pens, and a cow escapes during the blue team's run. As the competition intensifies, one cowboy tries to get rid of his biggest competition. Unimpressed by how the teams handled the challenge, Trace shakes things up by sending two cowboys home.</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E03</episode-num>
    <desc>Bat Masterson, former gunfighter and sheriff, is now working as a newspaperman. He heads west again to uncover the story behind one of the country's greatest train robberies. Although Butch and Sundance are long gone, Masterson tracks down Sundance's former girlfriend, Etta Place, to draw out more details. To pull off the audacious robbery, they used official Union Pacific lanterns to signal the train and fool the engineer into believing a bridge was out. As Etta reluctantly relives the events of the robbery and its aftermath, it's obvious that she is still smitten by Sundance after all of these years.</desc>

    <desc>With only eight cowboys left, the competition is neck-and-neck, and everyone has their eyes set on the immunity buckle.

In the elimination challenge, each team has to sort a herd of cattle by their ear tag colors and drive them into three separate corrals. The blue team comes together to implement a strategy that proves to be effective. The green team makes a risky decision that could cost them the challenge. During elimination, a contestant throws their biggest rival under the bus yet again. Trace sends another cowboy packing.</desc>
