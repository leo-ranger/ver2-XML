    <desc>Country music icon, Trace Adkins, hosts INSP's first competition show, Ultimate Cowboy Showdown. Twelve real working cowboys from all walks of life lock horns for a prize that could change their lives. As the contestants get settled in on a cattle ranch, friendships form and tensions rise between them. Things heat up between two of the competitors when a cowboy feels disrespected. In the first challenge, the cowboys are split up into two teams where they must sort their own team's cattle out of a mixed herd. Trace welcomes two expert cattlemen to help judge their performances. In the end, Trace sends two contestants packing, leaving only ten cowboys standing.</desc>
