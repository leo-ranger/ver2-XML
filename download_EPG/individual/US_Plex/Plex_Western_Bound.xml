    <desc>Bubba's in a pinch when Cody urges him to ease his aching back with acupuncture. Cody and Misty have to find out why their herd is losing so many stillborn calves before it threatens their new business. Booger discovers the ups and downs of daddy duty when he takes care of Matthew for the day. He draws on the bonding time he had with his own grandfather to make a special new memory. The cowboys put their steakhouse dreams on the line to recruit a business partner and are confronted with their next steps: developing a full menu and creating a pop-up restaurant.</desc>

    <desc>The cowboys are more at home on the range than behind a desk, so when lost paperwork results in lost income, they agree that they need to lasso in some secretarial help. Bubba's back injury might keep him out of the saddle, but nothing can stop him from galloping ahead with making Andie's first birthday unforgettable with a secret surprise. Booger jumps at the chance to rebuild his family legacy by buying back his granddaddy's land, but is discouraged when his high-emotion offer is too low for the sellers. While Cody is eager to wow potential restaurant partners, his black-eyed peas - and just about everything else the guys dish up - get a big thumbs down from two chefs, threatening their plans for a pop-up steakhouse.</desc>

Working with Bubba's feisty new colt, Booger schools his over-confident apprentice on the skills of training horses. The steakhouse plans gallop ahead with the cowboys taking lessons to learn more about the industry. Cody polishes his etiquette and studies the proper way to set a table, Bubba becomes Chef Thompson after a professional cook turns up the heat in the kitchen, and Booger partners with a butcher to sharpen his knowledge of beef. When their equipment fails, Cody and Misty unload new cow pens the old-fashioned way. When he gets the okay from his chiropractor, a relieved Bubba jumps back on his horse and rides off into the sunset with Kaley.</desc>

Horse expert Booger teaches a young polo player how to ride western style, but after she challenges him to join her on the polo field, who's really getting schooled?

To get more family time, Cody and Misty do a drive-thru date on horseback, and he clears the family fishing hole to lift his ailing Paw-Paw's spirits. And, after their crash course in cooking, one final taste test determines if Chef Bill will partner up with the cowboys to keep their restaurant dreams alive. They present their best dishes to some of the toughest critics they'll ever meet: their wives.</desc>

    <desc>The thirteen remaining cowboys face their first immunity challenge that tests their individual skills. The contestants race to score the fastest time in barrel racing and calf roping. While most cowboys impress Trace and the judges, only one will be safe from the next elimination. For the team challenge, the cowboys take on a group of untrained horses that they have to break, saddle, and ride. In the end, it all comes down to strategy, and the team that thinks ahead takes the win. After a few choice words, teammates lock horns, determined to out-cowboy the other. When an unexpected cowboy heads home, the rest of the contestants realize every move they make counts in this competition.</desc>
