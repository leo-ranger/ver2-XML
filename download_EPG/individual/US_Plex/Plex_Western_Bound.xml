At a time when only ten percent of physicians are female, Dr. Anderson faces her share of doubters and has a difficult time attracting patients in the frontier town. When miners suddenly rush into her office with an injured boy, she defies prevailing wisdom and decides to save his mangled arm instead of amputating the limb. The risks are enormous. If the boy's arm becomes infected, and he dies, she will lose everything. Years later, Dr. Anderson relives the story while treating Bat Masterson, legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman, who comes down with fever while passing through Cripple Creek.</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E01</episode-num>
    <desc>Today, the buffalo is the quintessential symbol of strength, freedom, and the unspoiled American West. But in the late 1800s, the nation's buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America's grasslands once again.</desc>
