    <desc>The cowboys team up to wrangle dangerous long-horned cattle for a fellow rancher. Working with Bubba's feisty new colt, Booger schools his over-confident apprentice on the skills of training horses. The steakhouse plans gallop ahead with the cowboys taking lessons to learn more about the industry. Cody polishes his etiquette and studies the proper way to set a table, Bubba becomes Chef Thompson after a professional cook turns up the heat in the kitchen, and Booger partners with a butcher to sharpen his knowledge of beef. When their equipment fails, Cody and Misty unload new cow pens the old-fashioned way. When he gets the okay from his chiropractor, a relieved Bubba jumps back on his horse and rides off into the sunset with Kaley.</desc>

    <desc>The cowboys team up to get their new herd feed-broke, but a stuck truck means super-mom, super-secretary Kaley has to save the day. Horse expert Booger teaches a young polo player how to ride western style, but after she challenges him to join her on the polo field, who's really getting schooled? Bubba and Kaley anxiously wait to share their daughter's first steps. To get more family time, Cody and Misty do a drive-thru date on horseback, and he clears the family fishing hole to lift his ailing Paw-Paw's spirits. And, after their crash course in cooking, one final taste test determines if Chef Bill will partner up with the cowboys to keep their restaurant dreams alive. They present their best dishes to some of the toughest critics they'll ever meet: their wives.</desc>

While most cowboys impress Trace and the judges, only one will be safe from the next elimination. For the team challenge, the cowboys take on a group of untrained horses that they have to break, saddle, and ride. In the end, it all comes down to strategy, and the team that thinks ahead takes the win. After a few choice words, teammates lock horns, determined to out-cowboy the other. When an unexpected cowboy heads home, the rest of the contestants realize every move they make counts in this competition.</desc>

    <desc>The twelve remaining cowboys saddle up for another immunity challenge - tournament-style pasture roping.

Guest judge, eight-time PRCA Champion Fred Whitfield, joins Trace and the other judges to help narrow down the immunity buckle winner. The cowboys compete in a grueling relay race for the elimination challenge that tests their horsemanship and showcases various riding skills. The relay race takes its toll on a contestant's horse, slowing down the blue team. After an avoidable mistake, the green team suspects one of their own of sabotage. Trace ups the ante, sending two cowboys home and leaving the rest in shock.</desc>
