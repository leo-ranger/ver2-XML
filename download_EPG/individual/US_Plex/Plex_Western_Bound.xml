    <desc>Just days on the job and brandishing a homemade badge, nineteen-year-old Deputy Elfego Baca's courage is immediately put to the test. After arresting a drunken cowboy for shooting up a saloon, Baca faces down the cowboy's friends, who are hired guns for a wealthy rancher. He wins the first skirmish, but the cowboys return with reinforcements and the stage is set for the biggest and longest gunfight in Old West history. Baca seeks shelter in a small adobe house and makes his stand against a small army of men who shoot up the house with thousands of rounds of ammunition over the course of 33 hours. Years later, legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson gets the real story of what comes to be known as the Frisco Shootout from the former sheriff who deputized Baca just prior to the legendary gun battle.</desc>

    <desc>When notorious outlaw Bill Doolin escapes from jail, the U.S. Marshals Service springs into action to end his four-year crime spree. Known as the Three Guardsmen, Deputy U.S. Marshals Heck Thomas, Bill Tilghman, and Chris Madsen have a reputation for always getting their man, but they know it won't be easy with Doolin. Doolin is no ordinary outlaw: as a former member of The Dalton Gang and the mastermind of The Wild Bunch, he has successfully robbed banks, trains, and stagecoaches. After months of tracking Doolin, Heck Thomas is so close he barely stops to eat or sleep. When Thomas and his posse finally corner Doolin, he refuses to surrender, and gunfire is the only way out. Some years later, Bat Masterson, former-gunfighter-turned-newspaperman, catches up with Bill Tilghman to hear the real story behind the hunt for the outlaw Bill Doolin.</desc>

    <desc>After frontiersman Daniel Boone forges paths across the Appalachian Mountains and into the newly discovered lands of Kentucky, he founds the settlement of Boonesborough, which quickly becomes one of the most important outposts on colonial America's frontier. But this westward expansion comes at a price. Despite agreements made with the powerful Cherokee nation, conflict between the settlers and natives soon rages like wildfire. For Boone, the strife becomes intensely personal when his daughter and two other young women are abducted by Hanging Maw, a fearsome Cherokee chief. In a desperate chase, Boone pursues Hanging Maw's warriors and their captives through untamed wilderness, with his daughter's life hanging in the balance.</desc>

    <desc>It's now down to the top five cowboys. In the last immunity challenge of the season, Trace tests the competitors' cattle IQ with a trivia challenge - the cowboy way. For every true or false question, the cowboys must rope a steer wearing a sign with the correct answer to earn a point, and the cowboy with the most points wins. One cowboy's strategy to hang back and let the other contestants take themselves out backfires. In the elimination challenge, Trace gets rid of the teams! It may be every cowboy for themself, but they still have to work together to separate two bulls from a herd of cattle. The cowboys debate over how to get the job done, but they eventually reach an agreement. When their plan quickly goes south and puts them all in danger, two cowboys lock horns, and the arena heats up during elimination. The judges make a major revelation about the challenge, and the cowboy with a bossy attitude gets the boot.</desc>

    <sub-title>Bat Masterson &amp; the Dodge City Dead Line: Part 1</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E10</episode-num>
    <desc>Legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson looks back on his time as sheriff of Dodge City when he and Wyatt Earp worked together to bring law and order to the notorious frontier town. As they struggle to pacify the rowdy cowhands passing through town, the two men draw their own proverbial line in the sand. South of the railroad track that splits the town, they let the cowboys run wild. But on the north side, they outlaw all guns in an effort to create a zone of civility. When a troublemaker crosses this dead line with his gun, it sets off a chain reaction of violence that endangers the town's beloved entertainer, the celebrated singer Dora Hand.</desc>

    <desc>Legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson looks back on his time as sheriff of Dodge City when he and Wyatt Earp worked together to bring law and order to the notorious frontier town. As they struggle to pacify the rowdy cowhands passing through town, the two men draw their own proverbial line in the sand.

When a troublemaker crosses this dead line with his gun, it sets off a chain reaction of violence that ends the life of the town's beloved entertainer, the celebrated singer Dora Hand. After tracking down her killer, Masterson shoots him in the arm as he tries to escape. When the judge learns there are no witnesses, however, he sets the killer free due to lack of evidence, leaving Masterson with a moral dilemma. Does he seek revenge or await the slow wheel of justice?</desc>

    <sub-title>Lewis &amp; Clark: Captains of Discovery</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E04</episode-num>
    <desc>Under orders from President Jefferson to explore America's vast unknown frontier, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark lead an expedition up the Missouri River in an attempt to reach the Pacific Ocean...a journey no American has made before, and one that may not even be possible. Leaving Fort Mandan after their first winter on the frontier, the Corps of Discovery enters completely uncharted territory. But as the waterways they travel become too shallow for boats, Lewis and Clark desperately seek the Shoshone tribe and their horses. To communicate with the elusive tribe, they rely on Sacagawea, a 16-year-old Shoshone woman, who accompanies the expedition with her newborn son. Lewis and Clark hope Sacagawea will help them trade for the Shoshone's horses, which will provide the only means of crossing the forbidding Rocky Mountains before winter returns.</desc>

    <title>Ultimate Cowboy Showdown</title>
    <sub-title>Every Cowboy for Themselves</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S02E09</episode-num>
    <desc>The competition takes a new turn now that it's down to the top four cowboys. This time around, there's no immunity challenge, and teams are a thing of the past. Every cowboy stands on their own, and one wrong move could cost them the competition. The cowboys have two shots at making it to the final three with a two-part elimination challenge. In Part One, the first cowboy to rope, drive and load two steers and their horse in a trailer wins. Two cowboys are neck and neck the entire round, but only one comes up on top. Part two's obstacle course tests the contestants' control and handling of the unruly colts they've been training since early on in the competition. But just when the finish line is in view, Trace throws a curveball into the competition that catches the cowboys off guard. While some thrive under the pressure, ultimately, the cowboy that can't adapt in the moment goes home.</desc>
