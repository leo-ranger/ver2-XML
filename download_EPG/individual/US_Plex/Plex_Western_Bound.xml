    <desc>Booger and Cody team up to pen a herd of cattle, but a stubborn cow takes refuge in a fishing hole, requiring some creative wrangling. The stress of maintaining a long-distance relationship leads Bubba and Kaley to move back to Alabama for good. Booger embraces his new role as a family man and enlists young Matthew to help surprise Jaclyn with a much needed home-improvement project. Cody helps Misty throw a beef-tasting party for potential buyers. As the guys ponder using their cowboy skills to open a steak house, they decide to get some on-the-job training by working a shift during the hectic dinner rush at a local eatery.</desc>

Booger enlists a bullfighter to help him wrangle his ornery Brahman cattle, and considers whether or not he has enough land to maintain the growing herd. Misty gives Cody a gift from the heart that captures both their past as a couple and honors their growing family legacy as ranchers. The guys pitch each other competing ideas for their future steakhouse, and Cody's brainstorm stands out as the one with true cowboy vision - including a name for their venture.</desc>

    <desc>The three remaining cowboys go head-to-head in a dramatic final showdown to prove they have more heart, grit, and cowboy skills than their fellow competitors. In the arena, the cowboys are tested individually on roping and reining. The extremely technical challenge puts the contestants on edge. An impressive performance by one of the competitors sets the bar high for the rest of the cowboys. Out in the field, the contestants have to work together as a team in their last challenge. The cowboys must successfully drive a herd through a grueling three-mile journey of pastures and pines, navigating multiple obstacles throughout the way. Feeling the pressure to win, bad communication puts the herd in a dangerous situation when a group of their cattle wanders onto a busy road. Trace spends one-on-one time with the remaining cowboys, evaluates their performances throughout the competition, and names the first-ever winner of the Ultimate Cowboy Showdown.</desc>

In the first of many challenges, the cowboys work in teams to sort gold-tagged cattle from a mixed herd. When miscommunication affects a team's performance, they have to answer to Trace. After consulting with two expert judges, Trace eliminates the team member who didn't pull their weight.
