    <desc>Dr. Phil takes goes inside the unthinkable: making your own child sick to fulfill a disturbing need for attention. The idea might sound unimaginable, but for people with a psychological disorder called Munchausen by Proxy, it's irresistible. Note: Viewer discretion is advised.</desc>

    <sub-title>Lottery Win Ruining Our Marriage</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S13E96</episode-num>
    <desc>Jodie says ever since her husband, Edwin, won $1.66 million in a lottery pool two years ago, he has become angry, distant and secretive -- and their marriage has gone downhill fast. She claims Edwin has squandered most of the winnings without her knowledge -- even buying a house for one of his family members without consulting her -- and she can’t trust him. She also says Edwin has a drinking problem, which she claims has resulted in explosive fights and arrests. Edwin denies having an alcohol problem and says he just drinks to escape Jodie’s nagging -- and he feels she’s only with him for the money. Why does he say their marital problems started long before his big lottery win? And, how does he explain his spending? Plus, Jodie’s mom, Linda, says Edwin has become a jerk toward Jodie’s 11-year-old twin girls from a previous relationship, while treating his 1-year-old daughter with Jodie like a princess. Is Edwin playing favorites? The couple sits down with Dr. Phil in a last-ditch effort to repair the damage. Can this marriage be saved?</desc>
