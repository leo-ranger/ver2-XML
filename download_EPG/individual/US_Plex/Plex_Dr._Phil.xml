    <sub-title>A Teen’s Near Fatal Decision</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S21E313</episode-num>
    <desc>The conversation about the rise in mental health issues among young people continues. Dr. Phil speaks with 22-year-old Emma, who says she was a cheerleader and “picture-perfect American girl” who appeared happy on the outside but was secretly struggling with severe anxiety and depression, which led her to make a near-fatal decision that changed her life forever. Ross Szabo, the wellness director at Geffen Academy at UCLA, the CEO of the Human Power Project, and co-author with Melanie Hall of Behind Happy Faces: Taking Charge of Your Mental Health, says he has ideas to implement more mental health education in schools. And, Massachusetts's Congressman Seth Moulton shares his latest project: the new 9-8-8 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Americans experiencing a mental health crisis or who are concerned about the mental health of a loved one are now able to dial 9-8-8 and get rapid, free, trained and confidential help from a network of 200+ local crisis centers nationwide.</desc>

    <desc>Jodie says ever since her husband, Edwin, won $1.66 million in a lottery pool two years ago, he has become angry, distant and secretive -- and their marriage has gone downhill fast. She claims Edwin has squandered most of the winnings without her knowledge -- even buying a house for one of his family members without consulting her -- and she can’t trust him. She also says Edwin has a drinking problem, which she claims has resulted in explosive fights and arrests. Edwin denies having an alcohol problem and says he just drinks to escape Jodie’s nagging -- and he feels she’s only with him for the money. Why does he say their marital problems started long before his big lottery win? And, how does he explain his spending? Plus, Jodie’s mom, Linda, says Edwin has become a jerk toward Jodie’s 11-year-old twin girls from a previous relationship, while treating his 1-year-old daughter with Jodie like a princess. Is Edwin playing favorites? The couple sits down with Dr. Phil in a last-ditch effort to repair the damage. Can this marriage be saved?</desc>

Kayla's mom, Jill, and stepdad, Mike, believe Kayla got pregnant intentionally, to earn a role on one of the popular teen pregnancy reality TV shows -- a claim Kayla denies. Kayla says as a teen mom, she quickly realized she was in over her head and signed custody of Milo over to her mom. Jill and Mike say that Kayla is immature and would rather party than be a mother. Can Dr. Phil get Kayla to step up and be the mom her son needs? Then, Vincent joins the show with his father, Lewis. Who do they believe should be raising Milo? And, is Vincent doing all he can to be a good father? Plus, do you think TV shows about teen mothers glamorize or prevent teen pregnancy? And, tune in to learn about the three most important conversations that you must have with your daughter.</desc>

What is at the root of Brandon's anger? Dr. Phil spends some one-on-one time with the young man to determine what’s driving his behavior.
