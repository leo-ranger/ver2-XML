Even though he’s Nigerian, 30 years younger, and she’s never physically met him, she insists it’s true love. She’s purchased a ticket to Nigeria and hopes to marry Victor, but her older sister, Carmen, her best friend, Angela, and her 19-year-old son, Anthony, say Josie is acting like a teenage fool. They believe Victor is conning Josie into marrying him for a green card. Dr. Phil took cameras to Nigeria to find Victor to see if he’s telling Josie the truth. Josie’s family says they want Dr. Phil to convince Josie that this relationship will never work. Is Victor who he says he is, and will Josie leave for Nigeria after hearing what Dr. Phil has to say?</desc>

    <desc>Trisha and Danielle say they are furious with their father, Ron, who they say abandoned their dying mother -- his wife of 30 years -- to plan a wedding with an alleged Kennedy heiress he met online. The daughters are convinced “Misty Kennedy” is really a catfish, and they want to open their father’s eyes. But Ron says despite never having met “Misty” in person, he believes his fiancée is the real deal and the love of his life. Dr. Phil brings everyone together in search of answers. Who is “Misty Kennedy”?</desc>
