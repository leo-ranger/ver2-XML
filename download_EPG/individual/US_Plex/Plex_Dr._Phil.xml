    <desc>Theresa says her fiancé, Bill’s, ex-girlfriend, Melissa, is jealous and obsessed with trying to ruin their relationship. She claims Melissa is a “psycho stalker” who is making their lives “hell” by sending Bill naked pictures of herself and showing up at his workplace unannounced. Melissa, who has a 3-year-old son with Bill, blames Theresa for destroying their family. She says Bill cheated on her with Theresa when she was pregnant with their son - so for revenge, she claims she has slept with Bill several times since he has been with Theresa. Bill admits he has made mistakes, including cheating on Theresa twice with Melissa but claims she took advantage of him. He says he’s tired of being stuck in the middle of their drama and just wants to peacefully co-parent with Melissa and marry his true love, Theresa but is he sending mixed messages? And, Theresa says she doubts Bill is the father of Melissa’s 3-year-old son. What will the paternity results reveal? And, will everyone heed Dr. Phil’s advice to bring resolution to this drama-filled love triangle?</desc>

Anna says she was outraged when she discovered her daughter, Allie’s, secret addiction to prescription pills. Allie maintains that she’s been clean for four months, but Anna doesn’t believe her. She says the 19-year-old has been involved in three car accidents in the past seven months, and the police recently brought her home for erratic driving. Does Allie still have a problem with prescription meds? Will she agree to take a drug test? Then, 17 year-old Elizabeth wrote in to the Teen Talk forum because she says she’s leading a double life. She says her secret is eating her up inside, and she wants to confess to her parents. Find out what the young woman’s been hiding, and see how her folks respond when she drops the bombshell.</desc>

One website offers a Dr. Phil quiz to win $5,000 every hour, another says it has the official Dr. Phil personality test, but even more shocking are 800 numbers that take callers' money for the promise of over the phone therapy with Dr. Phil and Robin. But these 800 numbers connect innocent victims with con artists posing as Dr. Phil staff members. The fake staffers ask anywhere from $375 to $1,000 for consultation time that obviously never takes place.</desc>

    <desc>Traci says her former friend, Jinda, is obsessed and infatuated with her. Traci says Jinda began texting her about 50 times a day after they first met -- texts that soon became over-the-top proclamations such as, “I can’t get you out of my mind," and “I swear I will love you the right way.” Traci says she thought Jinda just needed a friend but then grew more uncomfortable as, she claims, Jinda was also inappropriately affectionate with her children, began texting her friends whom she had never met, and even tried to touch and kiss her. Traci claims Jinda crossed the line when she tried to sabotage her marriage, so she cut off communication with her. But is Jinda getting the message? Traci says Jinda still texts and drives by her house, and she worries what Jinda might do next. Jinda admits to being "needy and clingy" but does she see that she's overstepped her boundaries? Can Dr. Phil help her rein in her behavior? Then, Kari says her sister, Holly, stabbed her in the back when she took Kari’s ex-husband’s side during their divorce -- and, after not speaking for three years, she wants an apology. Holly says she’s not sorry and that Kari is the one who needs to apologize. Can Dr. Phil end the silence between these sisters?</desc>

    <desc>Dr. Phil talks to controlling guests and the loved ones who feel trapped by them. Jeffrey hates that his wife of seven months, Mindy, goes out clubbing with her younger friends, who he says are a bad influence on her. Mindy leaves the kids with Jeffrey's 16-year-old daughter and parties until 6:00 a.m., while he works the night shift. Mindy calls Jeffrey “a warden,” and says if he had his way, she’d never leave the house. Then, Jason claims his wife, Terrie, is lazy. He says he has to clean the house, do chores, take care of the kids and balance two checkbooks! Terrie says her large chest and arthritis prevent her from doing household tasks. Can Jason get his wife to clean up her act?</desc>
