    <sub-title>Lottery Win Ruining Our Marriage</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S13E96</episode-num>
    <desc>Jodie says ever since her husband, Edwin, won $1.66 million in a lottery pool two years ago, he has become angry, distant and secretive -- and their marriage has gone downhill fast. She claims Edwin has squandered most of the winnings without her knowledge -- even buying a house for one of his family members without consulting her -- and she can’t trust him. She also says Edwin has a drinking problem, which she claims has resulted in explosive fights and arrests. Edwin denies having an alcohol problem and says he just drinks to escape Jodie’s nagging -- and he feels she’s only with him for the money. Why does he say their marital problems started long before his big lottery win? And, how does he explain his spending? Plus, Jodie’s mom, Linda, says Edwin has become a jerk toward Jodie’s 11-year-old twin girls from a previous relationship, while treating his 1-year-old daughter with Jodie like a princess. Is Edwin playing favorites? The couple sits down with Dr. Phil in a last-ditch effort to repair the damage. Can this marriage be saved?</desc>

Emotions run high when Penny faces her father, Ted, for the first time in two years and drops a bombshell: She believes he hired a hitman to kill Shannon. Ted admits his relationship with Shannon was strained at the time, but he vehemently denies he had anything to do with her death. How will Ted react to Penny’s accusation? Tune in to watch the drama unfold as this father and daughter angrily level charges against each other -- can Penny and Ted find a way to repair their relationship, or have the accusations gone too far?</desc>
