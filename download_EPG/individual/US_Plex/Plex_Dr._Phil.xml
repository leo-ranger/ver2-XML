    <episode-num system="onscreen">S10E39</episode-num>
    <desc>Horrific allegations are tearing a family apart — but who is telling the truth? Todd says he was shocked and appalled when his ex-girlfriend's mother, Diana, accused him of molesting his 4-year-old daughter, Taniya, and turns to Dr. Phil to help clear his name. Diana says that while babysitting Taniya, the toddler detailed ways in which Todd inappropriately touched her, and she's convinced he's done the unthinkable. After learning of the accusations, Taniya's mom, Latia, reported the alleged sexual abuse to a judge who immediately stripped Todd of his parental rights — but was justice served? Latia says that as much as she wants to believe Todd's innocence, as a mother, she needs to take every precaution to protect her child. A year has passed since he's seen his daughter, and Todd says he will go to any length to prove his innocence, including taking another a lie detector test — even though he's already passed one. He's adamant that Diana is lying and says that she coached Taniya to make the accusations. Dr. Phil calls in an expert polygraph examiner. Don't miss the shocking results!</desc>
