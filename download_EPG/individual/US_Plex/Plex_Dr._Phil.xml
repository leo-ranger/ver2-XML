Nikki, Paige’s stepmom, thinks she and her husband should raise the child, because they can better provide for her, and she wants Paige to break up with Jordan. Why does she believe that Jordan is brainwashing Paige? The teen dad says Nikki is the one who’s controlling, and he’s stepped up to the plate. Will the families come to an agreement? See what Dr. Phil tells them they must do to ensure Miley grows up in a healthy environment. Plus, find out the 10 things teens want their parents to know about teen sex.</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S13E17</episode-num>
    <desc>Jessica says her mother, Patricia, claims she is defying the odds by becoming a record-setting weight lifter while simultaneously battling Stage 3 brain cancer. But Jessica insists her mother isn’t sick at all and that she is lying about her health to gain sympathy and attention. She says Patricia has been spinning stories about various medical ailments for as long as she can remember -- and it’s time to come clean. Patricia strongly denies her daughter’s accusations and insists her diagnosis and incredible survival story are real. Why does she claim Jessica is out to get her? Emotions run high when mother and daughter meet on Dr. Phil’s stage. Do Patricia’s claims hold up? And, can this mother and daughter repair their fractured relationship?</desc>
