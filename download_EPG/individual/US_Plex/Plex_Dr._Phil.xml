    <desc>Parents: How well do you know your teen? Could your daughter be indulging in harmful activities right beneath your nose? Anna says she was outraged when she discovered her daughter, Allie’s, secret addiction to prescription pills. Allie maintains that she’s been clean for four months, but Anna doesn’t believe her. She says the 19-year-old has been involved in three car accidents in the past seven months, and the police recently brought her home for erratic driving. Does Allie still have a problem with prescription meds? Will she agree to take a drug test? Then, 17 year-old Elizabeth wrote in to the Teen Talk forum because she says she’s leading a double life. She says her secret is eating her up inside, and she wants to confess to her parents. Find out what the young woman’s been hiding, and see how her folks respond when she drops the bombshell.</desc>

    <desc>Craig and Cherie say the last half of their 16-year marriage has been anything but happily-ever-after. Cherie says Craig is chauvinistic, verbally abusive and demands sex, which she admits she only gives him about three to four times a year. Craig says Cherie withholds sex to control him, and as a result, he has become a slave to his anger. Cherie fears the tension in their household is taking a toll on their 11-year-old daughter, who is often caught in the crossfire of their fighting. Dr. Phil challenges the couple to a communication test. Can they heal their wounds and rekindle their romance? Then, meet the couple who inspired the movie, The Vow. Shortly after Kim and Krickitt Carpenter were married, a terrible car crash changed everything. Krickitt lay in a coma for weeks, and awoke with no recognition of her husband. The couple shares their inspiring, though oftentimes heartbreaking, journey of falling in love all over again. How did they find their way back to each other? And what is it like seeing their lives played out on the big screen? If you’ve ever wondered whether love can survive the toughest of challenges, you won’t want to miss this show! This show contains strong sexual content. Viewer discretion advised.</desc>

    <desc>Traci says her former friend, Jinda, is obsessed and infatuated with her. Traci says Jinda began texting her about 50 times a day after they first met -- texts that soon became over-the-top proclamations such as, “I can’t get you out of my mind," and “I swear I will love you the right way.” Traci says she thought Jinda just needed a friend but then grew more uncomfortable as, she claims, Jinda was also inappropriately affectionate with her children, began texting her friends whom she had never met, and even tried to touch and kiss her. Traci claims Jinda crossed the line when she tried to sabotage her marriage, so she cut off communication with her. But is Jinda getting the message? Traci says Jinda still texts and drives by her house, and she worries what Jinda might do next. Jinda admits to being "needy and clingy" but does she see that she's overstepped her boundaries? Can Dr. Phil help her rein in her behavior? Then, Kari says her sister, Holly, stabbed her in the back when she took Kari’s ex-husband’s side during their divorce -- and, after not speaking for three years, she wants an apology. Holly says she’s not sorry and that Kari is the one who needs to apologize. Can Dr. Phil end the silence between these sisters?</desc>

He says he has to clean the house, do chores, take care of the kids and balance two checkbooks! Terrie says her large chest and arthritis prevent her from doing household tasks.

    <desc>It's the invasion of the in-laws! Despite an intervention by Dr. Phil, a couple and their respective mothers still struggle to get along. See how Ernie and Kerry are doing, and what happens when their moms agree to set their differences aside and meet for coffee. Since the last show, Kerry says her relationship with her mother-in-law has never been better! Unfortunately, her relationship with her mother has never been worse. Then, Alaina and Ray are married with two children, and they all live with Ray’s mother, Eda. The two women are constantly at each other’s throats and it's threatening the entire family. Is this household too close for comfort, and will they be able to find a solution?</desc>
