    <desc>The Army on horseback that once was the United States Cavalry is no more, for our Army today is a mechanized force. But 'cavalry' is a proud word in military terminology and no one displays that pride more than the men of the 1st Cavalry Division. Today, these men of the division keep alive the cavalry's legendary tradition of bravery by fighting, when they are called upon.</desc>
