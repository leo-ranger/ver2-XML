    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E01</episode-num>
    <desc>The main battle tank in many ways is the icon of 20th century warfare, but in the 21st century how relevant will it be? How effective will it be? And how much will it cost? The modern battle tank differs vastly from where it started and may in fact be reaching the end of its evolutionary process. Will tanks adapt to survive or be forced to retire from battle?</desc>

    <desc>April 16, 1917, for the first time in history, French tanks fight their way through the black sludge of Chemin des Dames. One year before, in October, British tanks tried their luck in Somme. In both cases, the long-awaited miracle did not take place. Yet, a century later, the tanks are still here, monsters of technology that are becoming increasingly efficient.</desc>

But now they have to clear the Germans and German allies out of the Crimea and liberate the rest of Western Ukraine. Hitler declared the Crimea a 'Festung,' meaning it should be held at all cost and to the last man. The German 17th Army was effectively destroyed in the process.</desc>

    <desc>By summer 1944, Germany has undeniably lost the battle of the USSR. After the Soviet victories at Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, and Leningrad, the Soviet Union, with its practically unlimited resources of manpower and matériel, begins to rapidly push the Germans back toward the German border. On 22 June 1944, Stalin launches Operation Bagration, named after a Russian hero of the Napoleonic Wars.</desc>

    <desc>On 22 June 1941, German pilots were the first to see the sun rise. Before the day was over, the Soviet Air Forces had lost almost 2 000 aircraft. The early German air superiority gave a significant boost to German confidence, and severely damaged Soviet military capability and morale.</desc>

    <desc>By 1943-1944, as the Germans are desperately struggling to hold their ground, they are increasingly hindered by the Soviet partisans, which contain many former Red Army soldiers that had been cut off behind enemy lines. The Germans responded with intensive counter-insurgency campaigns and brutal reprisals against the civilian population.</desc>
