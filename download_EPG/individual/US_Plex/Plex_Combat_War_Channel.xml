    <desc>Korea is still a front-line area, though the guns are silent. This truce-line documentary was filmed in the Korean Sector which is patrolled by soldiers day and night, through summer and winter. In this zone, the patrols of the Army act as eyes for all U.S. forces in Korea. The program serves as a timely reminder that what once happened in Korea must not happen again.</desc>

But 'cavalry' is a proud word in military terminology and no one displays that pride more than the men of the 1st Cavalry Division. Today, these men of the division keep alive the cavalry's legendary tradition of bravery by fighting, when they are called upon.</desc>

    <desc>'MiG Alley' is the name given by the U.S. Air Force pilots to the northwestern portion of North Korea, where the Yalu River empties into the Yellow Sea. During the Korean War, it was the site of numerous dogfights between U.S. fighter jets and those of the Soviet Union. As the site of the first large-scale jet-vs.-jet air battles, MiG Alley is considered the birthplace of jet fighter combat.</desc>

The modern battle tank differs vastly from where it started and may in fact be reaching the end of its evolutionary process. Will tanks adapt to survive or be forced to retire from battle?</desc>

One year before, in October, British tanks tried their luck in Somme. In both cases, the long-awaited miracle did not take place. Yet, a century later, the tanks are still here, monsters of technology that are becoming increasingly efficient.</desc>

    <desc>The idea of tanks began as an extension of armory, with technicians seeing the need for soldiers to traverse the battlefield while being fully protected from enemy fire. As the type of weaponry used in warfare increased in size and caliber, the type of armor required became too heavy and cumbersome, and so the advent of the tank was welcomed by armies worldwide.</desc>

    <desc>The Iraqis wait, divided between hope and fear. Members of the military attempt to save face, knowing that their equipment, which dates at best from the early 1970s, will not weigh heavily against the five hundred armored tanks and seventy thousand men who are equipped with the very latest technology.</desc>

    <desc>On the activities of the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions on the island. A 'Corsair' plane lays a smoke screen to protect tanks crossing a field north of Naha under Japanese artillery fire. Marines follow tanks across open terrain, and mop up Japanese hillside positions after the tanks' flamethrowers have been used. Bazookas are used against Japanese strong points to open a road west of Shuri.</desc>

    <desc>In World War Two machines like the tanks, ships and aircraft received much of the glory. But there was a whole fleet of lesser-known vehicles that made victory in Europe possible. Vehicles like the Jeep, that ensured the frontline troops were kept supplied, and the amphibious DUKW that allowed the Allies to land quickly on beaches and cross rivers en route to Berlin.</desc>

    <desc>For 300 years the Corps of Royal Engineers have been one of the most innovative parts of the British Army. In the First World War we look at the geophone - a device they used to detect enemy tunnellers. In World War II, Royal Engineers operated converted tanks that created bridges and cleared minefields. We examine the mobile robot that defused bombs on foreign battlefields and British streets.</desc>

    <desc>The main battle tank in many ways is the icon of 20th century warfare, but in the 21st century how relevant will it be? How effective will it be? And how much will it cost? The modern battle tank differs vastly from where it started and may in fact be reaching the end of its evolutionary process. Will tanks adapt to survive or be forced to retire from battle?</desc>
