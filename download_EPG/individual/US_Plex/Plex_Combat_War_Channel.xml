The modern battle tank differs vastly from where it started and may in fact be reaching the end of its evolutionary process. Will tanks adapt to survive or be forced to retire from battle?</desc>

    <desc>On the activities of the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions on the island. A 'Corsair' plane lays a smoke screen to protect tanks crossing a field north of Naha under Japanese artillery fire. Marines follow tanks across open terrain, and mop up Japanese hillside positions after the tanks' flamethrowers have been used. Bazookas are used against Japanese strong points to open a road west of Shuri.</desc>

    <desc>In World War Two machines like the tanks, ships and aircraft received much of the glory. But there was a whole fleet of lesser-known vehicles that made victory in Europe possible. Vehicles like the Jeep, that ensured the frontline troops were kept supplied, and the amphibious DUKW that allowed the Allies to land quickly on beaches and cross rivers en route to Berlin.</desc>

    <desc>For 300 years the Corps of Royal Engineers have been one of the most innovative parts of the British Army. In the First World War we look at the geophone - a device they used to detect enemy tunnellers. In World War II, Royal Engineers operated converted tanks that created bridges and cleared minefields. We examine the mobile robot that defused bombs on foreign battlefields and British streets.</desc>

    <desc>The main battle tank in many ways is the icon of 20th century warfare, but in the 21st century how relevant will it be? How effective will it be? And how much will it cost? The modern battle tank differs vastly from where it started and may in fact be reaching the end of its evolutionary process. Will tanks adapt to survive or be forced to retire from battle?</desc>

    <desc>April 16, 1917, for the first time in history, French tanks fight their way through the black sludge of Chemin des Dames. One year before, in October, British tanks tried their luck in Somme. In both cases, the long-awaited miracle did not take place. Yet, a century later, the tanks are still here, monsters of technology that are becoming increasingly efficient.</desc>
