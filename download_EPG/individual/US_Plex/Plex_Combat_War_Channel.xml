    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E01</episode-num>
    <desc>We focus on the machines that would have fought in a potential nuclear war. We tell of the 1961 stand-off at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin when Soviet T-54 tanks faced off with American M-48 Patton tanks. Had that resulted in all out war we may have seen the Russian BMP-1 mechanized infantry vehicle, the smallest tactical nuke fielded by the USA and an experimental flying Jeep.</desc>

    <desc>At the moment of greatest peril, using unorthodox tactics and on the back foot, the British army fought the Panzerarmee to a standstill and then routed and decimated the German armour. This is the story of the 'forgotten' Battle for Egypt, and the inside picture of the tactics that stopped the German tanks in their tracks.</desc>

Alexander I, the Russian Emperor, withdrew from Vilna to engage the enemy. Napoleon hoped for a quick victory, but the Russian strategy was to retreat and draw the invaders deeper into their territory. The French army's discipline waned.</desc>

Bagration got mortally wounded, but the Russians managed to repel the French attacks.</desc>

    <desc>The Battle of Britain is over. The Luftwaffe has been driven to exhaustion, and Germany suffers its first major defeat. Even though Britain remains undefeated, it is so isolated that Hitler has no concerns about turning his attention East. Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR, takes the Soviets completely by surprise and the Red Army suffers terrible casualties.</desc>
