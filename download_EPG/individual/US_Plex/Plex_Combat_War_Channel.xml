    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E01</episode-num>
    <desc>The main battle tank in many ways is the icon of 20th century warfare, but in the 21st century how relevant will it be? How effective will it be? And how much will it cost? The modern battle tank differs vastly from where it started and may in fact be reaching the end of its evolutionary process. Will tanks adapt to survive or be forced to retire from battle?</desc>

    <desc>April 16, 1917, for the first time in history, French tanks fight their way through the black sludge of Chemin des Dames.

Yet, a century later, the tanks are still here, monsters of technology that are becoming increasingly efficient.</desc>
