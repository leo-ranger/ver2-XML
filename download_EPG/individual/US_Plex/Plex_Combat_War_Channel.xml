    <desc>In June 1812, Napoleon's 'Grand Army' invaded Russia with over 800,000 soldiers. Despite initial optimism, they faced hardships like hunger and desertion.

Napoleon hoped for a quick victory, but the Russian strategy was to retreat and draw the invaders deeper into their territory. The French army's discipline waned.</desc>
