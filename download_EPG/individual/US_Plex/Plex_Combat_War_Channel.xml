    <desc>Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Polish and British have succeeded in de-coding the top secret German military codes known as 'Enigma.' This information, referred to as 'Ultra' by the Allies, becomes vital for the Allies' military situation in North Africa, the Soviet Union, and Northern France.</desc>

    <sub-title>The Battle for Germany</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E16</episode-num>
    <desc>Germany is retreating on all fronts and suffering defeat after defeat. The breach of Germany's pre-War borders now seems inevitable. Desperate, Hitler orders all males between the ages of 16 and 70 to enlist and fight for the fatherland. Nazi ideologues put faith in victory and the Nazis seem to vanquish and suppress all forms of doubt and resistance in the last months of the Reich.</desc>

    <desc>Germany has without question lost World War II in Europe, but Hitler, by now a heavily medicated and deluded character, refuses to give up hope; he orders the roughly one million German soldiers left in the ruined city to defend Berlin, now a strange mix of combat veterans, teenage boys from the Hitler Youth, and old men from the People's Army.</desc>

    <desc>It is late spring of 1942, and World War 2 is in full swing. A long way off from the front-line the Germans make an air landing operation in an attempt to get through to the Kirov railway and the White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal. The only obstacle in their way is an anti-aircraft artillery unit of corporal Vaskov and five young women in training.</desc>
