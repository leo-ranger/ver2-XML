    <desc>Tonight, on Most Shocking! From full throttle smashes ... to catastrophic collapses ... when forces collide, get ready for – HIGH OCTANE IMPACTS! An angry bull turns a cowering cowboy ... into a rodeo rocket. A drug crazed ex-con runs from the law ... and lets the bad times roll. A kiteboarder goes for big air ... and gets carried away. This is not a movie. Everything you're about to see is REAL. Brace yourself! This is, Most Shocking – HIGH OCTANE IMPACTS!</desc>
