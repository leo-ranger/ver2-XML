    <desc>Karena and Kasey are in the beautiful city of Rome and are on a learning curve about how to eat like a Roman. From Pasta Masters to finding out all about making traditional Italian dishes to being hand fed tripe, Rome is a city of discovery. - But it’s not all about the food as they head to Monte Cassino to visit the graves and battle-grounds where their whakapapa fought, as well as pay respect to where hundreds of other Kiwis lost their lives. - At the end of the week Karena and Kasey are tasked with cooking a three-course dinner for the Ambassador and a group of VIP guests, but have they bitten of more than they can chew?</desc>

    <desc>Ainsley kicks off his culinary trip down memory lane by showcasing dishes and recipes which celebrate holidays.

Long-time friend Aldo Zilli gives a masterclass in making a Crispy Chilli &amp; Parsley Calamari, and Ainsley transports us to the Islands of Greece with a Souvlaki, before ending his tour with an Italian-inspired Tiramisu.</desc>

    <desc>Today we’re in and around Birmingham, kicking off at Island Lounge, where married chefs Marlon and Dania, are showcasing their Caribbean cuisine. It’s not long before our hosts realise they’ve got their work cut out; firstly, trying to impress foodies Mustapha and Jamie, from Jungle Street Kitchen and then getting their voices heard over garrulous double act, Matt and Matt, from The Loft. As the evening unfolds, one duo displays their dubious dance moves and another diner demonstrates some very dodgy DJ’ing.</desc>

    <desc>In Sussex, business partners Will and Jack are kicking off the week with some decidedly risky fare from their restaurant MED. Head chef Will doesn't like to waste any part of the animal when it comes to his food so is including the hearts of the duck for his BBQ duck main. - Before they can even get to the main, head chef Amy from from Ami Bistro runs in to trouble with the trout tartare starter. Raw fish is just not her thing but her front of house guy, Ryan, is more than impressed by Will's luxurious beard.</desc>
