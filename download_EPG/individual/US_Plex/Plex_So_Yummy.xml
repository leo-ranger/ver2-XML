    <desc>In Sussex, business partners Will and Jack are kicking off the week with some decidedly risky fare from their restaurant MED. Head chef Will doesn't like to waste any part of the animal when it comes to his food so is including the hearts of the duck for his BBQ duck main. - Before they can even get to the main, head chef Amy from from Ami Bistro runs in to trouble with the trout tartare starter. Raw fish is just not her thing but her front of house guy, Ryan, is more than impressed by Will's luxurious beard.</desc>
