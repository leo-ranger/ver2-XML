    <desc>Today we’re in and around Birmingham, kicking off at Island Lounge, where married chefs Marlon and Dania, are showcasing their Caribbean cuisine. It’s not long before our hosts realise they’ve got their work cut out; firstly, trying to impress foodies Mustapha and Jamie, from Jungle Street Kitchen and then getting their voices heard over garrulous double act, Matt and Matt, from The Loft. As the evening unfolds, one duo displays their dubious dance moves and another diner demonstrates some very dodgy DJ’ing.</desc>
