    <desc>Ainsley takes inspiration from days beside the seaside. Starting with his “caribbean squash and chickpea roti with hot sauce yoghurt.” Bake Off winner, Candice Brown, brings all the fun of the fair with her naughty “toffee apple doughnuts.” Ainsley cooks up his take on a beachside classic for mate and comedian Alan Davies with his “crispy fish cakes,” “garden pea crush,” and “sweet potato wedges.” Olly Smith has hunted out the perfect wines for sipping by the seashore. And no trip to the beach would be complete without some ice cream. Luckily Ainsley has just the ticket with his “homemade honeycomb ice cream sundae with butterscotch sauce.”</desc>
