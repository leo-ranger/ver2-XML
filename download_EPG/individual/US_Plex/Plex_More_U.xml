    <desc>Daymara had big plans in 2020. Trips, work goals, and family outings were a few items on Daymara's to-do list. But when she collapsed getting out of bed one morning, all those plans on the horizon were immediately put on hold. After being rushed to the hospital Daymara was faced with an unexpected diagnosis. She had acute myeloid leukemia, a type of blood cancer. As this type of Leukemia can be aggressive, Daymara immediately began an intensive chemotherapy regime and a groundbreaking stem cell procedure that would eventually save her life. This stem cell procedure however would force her into isolation as her immune system was weakened. Regardless of what may have seemed like an insurmountable challenge, Daymara persevered and her determination to leave the hospital so she could be with her children again is what Daymara says gave her hope and the ability to get well again.</desc>

    <desc>Five decades ago, Lawrence Monk Terry was at the top of his game. In 1972 he won a silver medal with the U.S. rowing team at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich Germany. His position on the team was an important one. He served as the Stroke. That's the term for the one who sets the pace for the rest of the rowers. Since then, his life has been rowing along merrily. Just recently he was a fit and active retiree until an April day, after Monk was doing housework and decided it was time to come inside that his life would take a pause. What happened next would give a whole new meaning to his revered rowing position, The Stroke.</desc>
