    <desc>Set in Los Angeles, this series follows Jamiel Chambers, a blue chip high-schooler on the brink of escaping the desperate poverty that has berated inner city America. After his junior year ends with him leading his team to a second place finish in the state's regional tournament, Jamiel is hand-picked to play in the city's annual summer league All-Star game. With college recruits swarming and pro agents hedging, the media circus leans in, peddling the question mark around his future like rabid bookies. It is this exposure that gets the attention of Nick Collins, a derelict from a disreputable family from neighboring Irvine. After his doomed-from-the-start plan to capitalize on Jamiel's notoriety ends in with fatal results, family members from both sides are pulled into a series of events which will not only effect Jamiel's trajectory, but will set up one of the most intense family feuds the city has ever witnessed.</desc>

    <title>Ip Man</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Behind every great martial artist lies a teacher. Ip Man, starring Donnie Yen, is the award-winning film adaptation about the life story of Ip Man, grandmaster of Wing Chun and mentor to legendary kung fu superstar Bruce Lee. Set in Fo Shan, China during the Sino-Japanese War, Ip Man vividly brings to life the brutality of the infamous Japanese occupation, where once proud men are forced to fight to the death for a precious bag of rice. Defined by courage and humility, Ip Man, whose fighting skills are revered all over China, rises to the fore front. Upon refusing to teach his martial arts to the invading Japanese soldiers, he is forced to fight for the honor of his country in a series of battles that will culminate in a kill-or-be-killed showdown with Japan’s greatest fighter.</desc>
