    <desc>Set in Los Angeles, this series follows Jamiel Chambers, a blue chip high-schooler on the brink of escaping the desperate poverty that has berated inner city America. After his junior year ends with him leading his team to a second place finish in the state's regional tournament, Jamiel is hand-picked to play in the city's annual summer league All-Star game. With college recruits swarming and pro agents hedging, the media circus leans in, peddling the question mark around his future like rabid bookies. It is this exposure that gets the attention of Nick Collins, a derelict from a disreputable family from neighboring Irvine. After his doomed-from-the-start plan to capitalize on Jamiel's notoriety ends in with fatal results, family members from both sides are pulled into a series of events which will not only effect Jamiel's trajectory, but will set up one of the most intense family feuds the city has ever witnessed.</desc>
