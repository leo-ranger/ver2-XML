    <title>Ip Man 2</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>International superstar Donnie Yen reprises his iconic role as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip Man. Master Ip, a new arrival in British-occupied Hong Kong, wants to open a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. A corrupt cabal of martial arts masters, led by Master Hung (Sammo Hung) refuses to allow him to teach in peace until he proves himself in a series of fights against the local master, which Ip does, in style. But even after earning the respect of the local masters, Ip’s troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a new world of corruption and conflict between the Chinese locals and the British expats that run the city. When a Western-style boxer named “Twister” (Darren Shahlavi) comes to town to entertain the Brits, he insults Chinese martial arts in a horrifically violent way, and Ip is forced by honor to enter a brutal “King of the Ring” boxing match against Twister- and it’s East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish.</desc>

    <desc>Set in Los Angeles, this series follows Jamiel Chambers, a blue chip high-schooler on the brink of escaping the desperate poverty that has berated inner city America. After his junior year ends with him leading his team to a second place finish in the state's regional tournament, Jamiel is hand-picked to play in the city's annual summer league All-Star game. With college recruits swarming and pro agents hedging, the media circus leans in, peddling the question mark around his future like rabid bookies. It is this exposure that gets the attention of Nick Collins, a derelict from a disreputable family from neighboring Irvine. After his doomed-from-the-start plan to capitalize on Jamiel's notoriety ends in with fatal results, family members from both sides are pulled into a series of events which will not only effect Jamiel's trajectory, but will set up one of the most intense family feuds the city has ever witnessed.</desc>

    <title>Ip Man 2</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>International superstar Donnie Yen reprises his iconic role as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip Man. Master Ip, a new arrival in British-occupied Hong Kong, wants to open a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. A corrupt cabal of martial arts masters, led by Master Hung (Sammo Hung) refuses to allow him to teach in peace until he proves himself in a series of fights against the local master, which Ip does, in style. But even after earning the respect of the local masters, Ip’s troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a new world of corruption and conflict between the Chinese locals and the British expats that run the city. When a Western-style boxer named “Twister” (Darren Shahlavi) comes to town to entertain the Brits, he insults Chinese martial arts in a horrifically violent way, and Ip is forced by honor to enter a brutal “King of the Ring” boxing match against Twister- and it’s East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish.</desc>
