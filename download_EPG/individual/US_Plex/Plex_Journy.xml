    <desc>Over 54 days, five pairs of ordinary Brits took on the challenge of a lifetime and attempted to travel, at ground level, the entire length of Latin America: from Mexico City to Ushuaia, Argentina, the most southerly city in the world – with no planes, no credit cards and no smartphones in sight. They came across extreme weather, states of emergency, evacuations, challenging budgets as well as life-changing encounters, incredible acts of generosity and dramatic landscapes. Most of all, they had to survive each other.</desc>
