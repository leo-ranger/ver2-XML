    <desc>In the ultimate survival experiment, Bear Grylls has abandoned 14 British women on a remote desert island in the pacific with just the clothes they stand up in and a few basic tools.  This time the survival challenge is harder than before, as they attempt to survive entirely on their own wits for six weeks in the height of the tropical storm season. The women are desperately dehydrated and separated, after an expedition party crossed the island to find a permanent camp - and got hopelessly lost while returning to the others.</desc>

    <desc>It’s Lauren’s 25th birthday but there’s little to celebrate. Two castaways have already abandoned the women’s island due to the extreme conditions, since being dropped in the Pacific seven days ago. The 12 remaining are desperately dehydrated. The survival mantra goes: You can survive 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water and 3 weeks without food, so finding something to drink is these women’s number one priority.</desc>

They are living on an extreme low calorie diet, surviving on snails and limpets and scraps of scavenged yucca and coconut.</desc>

    <desc>In the ultimate survival experiment, Bear Grylls has abandoned 14 British women on a remote desert island in the Pacific with just the clothes they stand up in and a few basic tools. As the group approaches the four week mark of the experiment, the 10 remaining women are entering dangerous medical territory. With very little research about how the body copes with extreme survival beyond this point, it’s more important than ever that they keep up their food and water supply otherwise they risk long term damage to their vital organs. Yesterday the women feasted on their first big kill – a large pig. 25 year old Nurse Lauren along with 30 year old potter Beth have stayed up all night to preserve the left-over pork, requisitioning one of the group’s two precious jerrycans – normally reserved for their water purification system.</desc>

    <desc>In this special episode of The Island With Bear Grylls takes an in-depth look at life on the islands. On The Island, Bear conducted the ultimate survival challenge to see if 14 men and 14 women could survive for six weeks on an uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean. They were completely alone, filming everything themselves, with only a handful of basic tools and the clothes they stood up in. They not only had to survive entirely on their own wits for six gruelling weeks, but had to contend with the vicious tropical storm season.</desc>
