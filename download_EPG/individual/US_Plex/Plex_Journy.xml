This time the survival challenge will be harder and longer than before, as they attempt to survive entirely on their own wits for six weeks in the height of the tropical storm season. From the very beginning the men face a life and death struggle, as the fierce currents of the Pacific Ocean force Bear to drop them 75 meters off the island.  The men have no choice but to jump ship and make a desperate swim through the violent swells onto a treacherous, rocky coastline.</desc>

In this film mild mannered paramedic, Barney Strange, comes to the rescue of the group by catching and feeding the men a tasty but unusual supper. Just five days in and the group has reached breaking point.  The island has been battered by a series of torrential storms, and without a decent shelter the men have barely slept. They haven’t had a decent meal since they arrived, and a bitter rivalry between the island’s two builders, Paul and Andy has turned into all out war.  Along with the youngest member, Joe, they are now both hell bent on leaving the island, much to the despair of the others.</desc>
