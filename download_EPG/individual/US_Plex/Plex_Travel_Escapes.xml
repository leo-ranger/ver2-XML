    <desc>David Rocco always says, “I’m not a chef, I’m Italian”, especially when he’s encouraging people who are afraid of cooking to be brave! And, as evidenced in his television series and award winning best-selling cookbook “David Rocco’s Dolce Vita”, Italy has taught him well! In David Rocco’s Amalfi Getaway, David returns to Italy – this time to the Amalfi coast. Here, his journey takes viewers into the home kitchens, restaurants and farms of Amalfi to cook with the mammas, nonnas and chefs who make simple, honest, rustic Italian dishes – most in the ‘cucina povera’ tradition. These are the dishes that have defined the region for centuries and are sure to inspire cooks today. Heartfelt and informative, the series is also a celebration of the artisanal ingredients and time honoured Amalfi traditions that endure. With David, we cook with a top producer of world-famous Amalfi lemons at his breathtaking mountainside orchard. We learn how prized Mozzarella di Bufala – buffalo milk mozzarella — is made and best eaten. And we visit cooks and food producers in Agerola – the town with such exceptional food that, for centuries, it supplied the royal family of Naples. But food is only part of the story. For David, meeting, breaking bread and having fun with people is as much a part of the culture of food in Italy as the cooking itself. And, as we along with David are invited to the table, we see that the simple and delicious food of Amalfi connects us and brings happiness. Set against the stunning backdrop of the Amalfi coast, David Rocco’s Amalfi Getaway isn’t as much a how-to recipe show as a rich and sumptuous journey to inspiration. With heart and soul and passion for the people and food of Amalfi, David is sure to ignite the latent foodie in everyone!</desc>

In David Rocco’s Amalfi Getaway, David returns to Italy – this time to the Amalfi coast. Here, his journey takes viewers into the home kitchens, restaurants and farms of Amalfi to cook with the mammas, nonnas and chefs who make simple, honest, rustic Italian dishes – most in the ‘cucina povera’ tradition. These are the dishes that have defined the region for centuries and are sure to inspire cooks today. Heartfelt and informative, the series is also a celebration of the artisanal ingredients and time honoured Amalfi traditions that endure. With David, we cook with a top producer of world-famous Amalfi lemons at his breathtaking mountainside orchard. We learn how prized Mozzarella di Bufala – buffalo milk mozzarella — is made and best eaten. And we visit cooks and food producers in Agerola – the town with such exceptional food that, for centuries, it supplied the royal family of Naples. But food is only part of the story. For David, meeting, breaking bread and having fun with people is as much a part of the culture of food in Italy as the cooking itself. And, as we along with David are invited to the table, we see that the simple and delicious food of Amalfi connects us and brings happiness. Set against the stunning backdrop of the Amalfi coast, David Rocco’s Amalfi Getaway isn’t as much a how-to recipe show as a rich and sumptuous journey to inspiration. With heart and soul and passion for the people and food of Amalfi, David is sure to ignite the latent foodie in everyone!</desc>
