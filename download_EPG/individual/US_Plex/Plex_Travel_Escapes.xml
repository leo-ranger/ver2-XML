    <desc>In the Baharya Oasis, Dominic finds Ossam, a gentleman who waits until they’re riding to tell Dominic that he nearly died when he was lost in the desert at eight years old.

    <desc>John cycles with Dominic to Suez, where he swaps with the adventure's only female companion, Jasmine. She flies in the face of the traditional Middle Eastern female role by accepting this physical challenge and toughs out the last 3 days of the entire journey while recounting her own experiences in Tahrir Square during the revolution. This is also the journey's destination, and here we reflect on Egypt's future, uncertain, but for the strength and tenacity of its youth, which Dominic has experienced first hand.</desc>
