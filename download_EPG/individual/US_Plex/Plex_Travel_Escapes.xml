    <title>A Long Weekend in... With Rory O'Connell</title>
    <sub-title>Vienna</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E02</episode-num>
    <desc>Rory O’Connell’s brand new series combines travel and cookery with the popular chef enjoying the culture as well as the cuisine of eight European cities – Palma de Mallorca, Vienna, Lisbon, Madrid, Bath, Nantes, Copenhagen and Edinburgh. Rory visits a different city in each episode, and while the primary focus is on food, Rory is a knowledgeable guide to so much more, with art and design being particular interests of his. Food becomes much more interesting when seen in context – the culture it is part of the landscape it’s produced in, the history that has influenced it. At the end of each episode, Rory makes a delicious dish with the local produce which he sources on his travels.</desc>
