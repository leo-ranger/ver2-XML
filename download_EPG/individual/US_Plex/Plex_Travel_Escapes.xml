    <desc>Going Beyond is wanderlust-filled hitchhiker Mariia Khandus’s new travel project. She’s journeyed around the world. Everybody knows that Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia are great places to relax with wonderful beaches and delicious fruits! But what do you know about the local people? The expats? About the real lives of those living in these exotic countries? In our trip, we will discover it all, together! We visit the non-touristy places and show you the real Indochina! This is a set of stories of different people, through the prism of whom we show life in a country. It is a collection of diverse achievements, experiences and emotions. We are looking for the most interesting stories for you to keep expanding your own consciousness. Unbelievable panoramic views, interesting people, exciting stories and adventures – you’ll see all of this in our travel show, Going Beyond!</desc>
