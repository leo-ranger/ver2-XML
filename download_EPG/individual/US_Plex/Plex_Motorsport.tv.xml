    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The British Grand Prix didn’t disappoint, with a dream victory for Lando Norris, beating teammate Oscar Piastri after the Australian picked up a 10-second penalty for erratic driving behind the Safety Car. But the star of the show was Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg, who after 15 years and 239 starts in Formula 1, finally got his first podium finish.    Autosport Editor-In-Chief Kevin Turner sits down with Jake Boxall-Legge and Ronald Vording to discuss all the action and news from Silverstone. Including Hulk's "incredible" podium, whether Piastri should have been penalised, Max Verstappen's spin from second and the persistent rumours over his future, and Mohammed Ben Sulayem's challenger for FIA President, Tim Mayer.</desc>

    <desc>So, after several years of preparations, negotiations, public arguments, and even the US Department of Justice getting involved, Cadillac has finally been formally announced as Formula 1’s 11th team for the 2026 season! Today’s formal announcement confirms the handshake agreement that the sport had with General Motors last November. After a revised bid led by Dan Towriss of the TWG Group (Formerly Andretti) was accepted. The Silverstone-based project now has the green light to prepare for its first race in just 12 months as a customer team with Ferrari power units until General Motors builds its own version for 2028. Motorsport.Com’s Editor in Chief, Ben Hunt, reacts to this breaking news, with Laitta Chemelo, Editor at Motorsport.Com and Nascar Reporter at Motorsport.com, Nick DeGroot.</desc>

    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The British Grand Prix didn’t disappoint, with a dream victory for Lando Norris, beating teammate Oscar Piastri after the Australian picked up a 10-second penalty for erratic driving behind the Safety Car.

    <desc>So, after several years of preparations, negotiations, public arguments, and even the US Department of Justice getting involved, Cadillac has finally been formally announced as Formula 1’s 11th team for the 2026 season! Today’s formal announcement confirms the handshake agreement that the sport had with General Motors last November. After a revised bid led by Dan Towriss of the TWG Group (Formerly Andretti) was accepted. The Silverstone-based project now has the green light to prepare for its first race in just 12 months as a customer team with Ferrari power units until General Motors builds its own version for 2028. Motorsport.Com’s Editor in Chief, Ben Hunt, reacts to this breaking news, with Laitta Chemelo, Editor at Motorsport.Com and Nascar Reporter at Motorsport.com, Nick DeGroot.</desc>
