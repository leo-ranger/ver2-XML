    <title>1000 Lakes Rally 1986</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The Italian Lancia and the French Peugeot teams came to the renowned 1000 Lakes Rally hotly disputing the manufacturers' title, with Markku Alen matched against Timo Salonen. Peugeot, however, had another ace in the pack in the shape of 27 year-old rising local star Juha Kankkunen, who was looking extremely good for the drivers' championship. This video captures in enthralling fashion the red-hot battle through the Finnish forests, with their huge ‘yumps’ and flat-out straights.  Always a rally to set the pulses racing, Alen had the Lancia Delta running at its best and his ability to control the S4 at seemingly impossible speeds and angles will amaze the viewer. Supporting him would be Kalle Grundel, specially released from his Ford RS200 commitments and pushing hard on his home territory. Again though, Peugeot were taking no chances by fielding the experienced Stig Blomqvist, also no stranger to the 1000 Lakes</desc>

    <desc>Becoming Team Principal for Haas' F1 team this year, Ayao Komatsu came from an engineering background, a rather unusual route for a Team Principal but one that he believes gives him an important perspective while pushing Haas towards the front of the grid. Stuart Codling got together with Ayao Komatsu at his favourite rock climbing centre (yes, we mean rock climbing) Big Rock Climbing in Milton Keynes to chat about his career, why rock climbing is so important to him, and how he's leading Haas in climbing up the F1 grid.</desc>
