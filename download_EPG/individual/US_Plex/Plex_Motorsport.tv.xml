    <title>How chaos ultimately decided the final podium lineup - F1 British GP Review</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The British Grand Prix didn’t disappoint, with a dream victory for Lando Norris, beating teammate Oscar Piastri after the Australian picked up a 10-second penalty for erratic driving behind the Safety Car. But the star of the show was Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg, who after 15 years and 239 starts in Formula 1, finally got his first podium finish.    Autosport Editor-In-Chief Kevin Turner sits down with Jake Boxall-Legge and Ronald Vording to discuss all the action and news from Silverstone. Including Hulk's "incredible" podium, whether Piastri should have been penalised, Max Verstappen's spin from second and the persistent rumours over his future, and Mohammed Ben Sulayem's challenger for FIA President, Tim Mayer.</desc>

    <desc>How did bargeboards evolve from a curved panel to the complex carbon fibre structures we see today? Especially over the last few years, we've seen an explosion in complexity infront of the sidepods, but how did we get here? Jake Boxall-Legge takes a look at the first ever, ultra simplistic bargeboard in Formula 1, the many variations we've seen since and how they are so crucial to today's machines and their aerodynamics.</desc>

    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Gearing Up is back with another thrilling episode that takes you on an exhilarating journey around the globe, showcasing the most unique and intense competitions the world has to offer.  In this episode, high skills, a passion for technology, an impatience for innovation, and a pure love for adrenaline are combined at their best. Buckle up, rev your engines, and get ready for some electrifying action as you experience the thrill of full G-force!    The episode kicks off with Monster Jam’s action. Monster Jam drivers are the best of the best. They make 6-ton Monster Jam trucks defy gravity and wow fans around the world. Each driver has a signature stunt they can’t wait to perform during the event. In this episode, some of Monster Jam’s most technical drivers will break down their favourite skills.    Then we go to Rally Jameel.  As the first women-only navigational rally in the Middle East, it has returned with its highly anticipated fourth edition and its first-ever cross-border expansion. Spanning five days and covering a 1,600-kilometer route across two countries, this year’s rally represents a historic expansion beyond Saudi Arabia, as everything would start from Petra, Jordan.    Lastly, finish off this episode by featuring the WaterJet World Series, one of the premier international jet ski racing competitions, typically consisting of several rounds held in different countries and continents.</desc>
