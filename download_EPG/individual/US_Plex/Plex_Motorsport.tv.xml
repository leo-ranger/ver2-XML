    <title>1000 Lakes Rally 1986</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The Italian Lancia and the French Peugeot teams came to the renowned 1000 Lakes Rally hotly disputing the manufacturers' title, with Markku Alen matched against Timo Salonen. Peugeot, however, had another ace in the pack in the shape of 27 year-old rising local star Juha Kankkunen, who was looking extremely good for the drivers' championship. This video captures in enthralling fashion the red-hot battle through the Finnish forests, with their huge ‘yumps’ and flat-out straights.  Always a rally to set the pulses racing, Alen had the Lancia Delta running at its best and his ability to control the S4 at seemingly impossible speeds and angles will amaze the viewer. Supporting him would be Kalle Grundel, specially released from his Ford RS200 commitments and pushing hard on his home territory. Again though, Peugeot were taking no chances by fielding the experienced Stig Blomqvist, also no stranger to the 1000 Lakes</desc>
