But was it just a flash in the pan, or the first sign that Brackley is on the way back to their dominant past?    In the video, we analyse Mercedes victory, the tyre management woes that have ailed them in recent year and the upgrades they've brought to combat it, and the future of the team with both George Russell and Kimi Antonelli both out of contract at the end of the current season.</desc>

    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Red Bull is much younger than Formula 1’s other big teams, having arrived in 2005. But in less than two decades it has racked up some impressive achievements.   Six drivers’ and five constructors’ titles headline a CV that includes 92 world championship grand prix wins, enough for sixth on the all-time list behind Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, Williams and Lotus.   For this list of top 10 F1 drivers, we’ve taken into account the amount of success the racers scored with Red Bull and its sister team Toro Rosso/AlphaTauri, the impact they had and the circumstances of their time within the Red Bull fold.    Want to know more about our top 10 or hear experts debate the list?
