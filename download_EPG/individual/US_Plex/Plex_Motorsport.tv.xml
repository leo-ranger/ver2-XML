    <desc>As the Formula 1 paddock sets up in Monaco, the late Niki Lauda is not far from anyone's thoughts following his death earlier this week. Inside the paddock, Edd Straw is joined by Giorgio Piola, who knew Lauda throughout his F1 career, to get a very personal account of what it was like to know the three-time world champion. Piola explains what made Lauda tick, and how his accident in 1976 changed him into a new person who was "even more wonderful than the first".</desc>

    <title>9 interesting F1 tests that didn’t lead to anything</title>

    <desc>Formula 1 testing has thrown up some interesting car and driver combinations over the years, and as this list shows, plenty of top-name drivers have turned up in unexpected places. But sometimes a test deal catches the eye then doesn’t lead to a more permanent arrangement, for a wide variety of reasons.

    <title>The Best Looking F1 Cars Of All Time</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>It's a debate as old as Formula 1 itself - which F1 car is the best looking? Throughout the last 70 years we've seen some real beauties, as well as some cars we'd rather we hadn't... but this time we're focussing on the top 10 cars we'll never get tired of looking at, ranging from more recent modern icons all the way back to the classics in the 50s. Thanks to Duke Archives for footage from their documentary "If You're Not Winning... You're Not Trying", following the Lotus team behind the scenes in 1973 as they win the Constructors Championship.

    <title>The history of driver bans in Formula 1</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Formula 1 drivers very rarely get banned from races - in fact, just five times in the history of the world championship has a driver sat out a race due to an official FIA sanction. But, unsurprisingly, F1's history of bans is a bit more complicated than that, so in this video we also look at the other drivers who have served what could be termed as 'unofficial' bans over the course of F1 history.</desc>

    <title>Why the 'second' Niki Lauda was even better than the first</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>As the Formula 1 paddock sets up in Monaco, the late Niki Lauda is not far from anyone's thoughts following his death earlier this week. Inside the paddock, Edd Straw is joined by Giorgio Piola, who knew Lauda throughout his F1 career, to get a very personal account of what it was like to know the three-time world champion. Piola explains what made Lauda tick, and how his accident in 1976 changed him into a new person who was "even more wonderful than the first".</desc>

    <title>9 interesting F1 tests that didn’t lead to anything</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Formula 1 testing has thrown up some interesting car and driver combinations over the years, and as this list shows, plenty of top-name drivers have turned up in unexpected places. But sometimes a test deal catches the eye then doesn’t lead to a more permanent arrangement, for a wide variety of reasons. Here we take a look at nine particularly high-profile drivers who had a brief try-out with a team, but didn’t end up signing a proper deal</desc>

    <title>The Best Looking F1 Cars Of All Time</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>It's a debate as old as Formula 1 itself - which F1 car is the best looking? Throughout the last 70 years we've seen some real beauties, as well as some cars we'd rather we hadn't... but this time we're focussing on the top 10 cars we'll never get tired of looking at, ranging from more recent modern icons all the way back to the classics in the 50s. Thanks to Duke Archives for footage from their documentary "If You're Not Winning... You're Not Trying", following the Lotus team behind the scenes in 1973 as they win the Constructors Championship.

    <title>The history of driver bans in Formula 1</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Formula 1 drivers very rarely get banned from races - in fact, just five times in the history of the world championship has a driver sat out a race due to an official FIA sanction. But, unsurprisingly, F1's history of bans is a bit more complicated than that, so in this video we also look at the other drivers who have served what could be termed as 'unofficial' bans over the course of F1 history.</desc>
