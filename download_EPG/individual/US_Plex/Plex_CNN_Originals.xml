    <episode-num system="onscreen">S05E01</episode-num>
    <desc>Aired 7/19/2020. Having met with the Ku Klux Klan in the first episode of United Shades five years ago, Kamau takes a deeper look into the damaging systemic applications of white supremacy in the United States. Through the lens of Pittsburgh and its local black leaders, writers and activists, Kamau investigates how this lauded progressive island masks a history of racism. Meeting with former leaders of the KKK and Nazis, as well as CNN correspondent Sara Sidner, Kamau examines the larger upwelling of national and international hate rhetoric in the current political era; an upwelling that led to the murder of eleven Jewish worshipers at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue.</desc>

As he travels across the state, he examines the once-thriving history of Black farmers who through racist economic and social practices, have been largely lost to time. He also talks to independent farmers who now face that same fate at the hands of international consolidation, political posturing and economic disparity. He discovers that the power of land ownership and representation is critical in the efforts to provide safe, reliable and accessible food for our nation.</desc>

    <desc>Aired 5/15/2022. Stanley Tucci visits Umbria, nicknamed The Green Heart of Italy. While this small, predominantly rural region lives in the shadow of its more glamourous neighbor, Tuscany, Umbria has an ancient history that predates even the Romans. And, with the highest consumption of pork per capita, Umbria is a carnivore’s dream. From wild boar hunts to incredible black truffle farms, Stanley will explore the riches this land has to offer, while also questioning whether old traditions and centuries of religious orthodoxy are preventing younger generations from breaking through.</desc>

    <title>Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy</title>
    <sub-title>Umbria</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S02E03</episode-num>
    <desc>Aired 5/15/2022. Stanley Tucci visits Umbria, nicknamed The Green Heart of Italy. While this small, predominantly rural region lives in the shadow of its more glamourous neighbor, Tuscany, Umbria has an ancient history that predates even the Romans. And, with the highest consumption of pork per capita, Umbria is a carnivore’s dream. From wild boar hunts to incredible black truffle farms, Stanley will explore the riches this land has to offer, while also questioning whether old traditions and centuries of religious orthodoxy are preventing younger generations from breaking through.</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S02E04</episode-num>
    <desc>Aired 5/22/2022. Stanley Tucci sets out to explore how Italian immigration has transformed the food scene in his adopted hometown of London. Forget what you think you know about this city. London is a culinary mecca where Italian food from every region gets a chance to shine. The burrata is so creamy and pasta is so fresh that it may rival Italy itself. For over a century, Italians here have found inventive ways to create Italian food so good it’s enough to render Stanley speechless.</desc>
