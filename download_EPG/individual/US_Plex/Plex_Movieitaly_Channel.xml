    <desc>Nicola Bellizzi returns to Naples, after spending six years in a juvenile detention centre, determined to get out of his outcast status and become a lawyer. In the neighbourhood, Gaetano, known as Core e' Fierro, is the absolute boss of the guapperia. A clash takes place between the two young men; but the behaviour of Nicola, who defends Gaetano from the commissioner Ajossa who has caught them duelling, gives rise to a deep friendship between the two. After many denials, driven by necessity, Nicola agrees to become a guappo in turn during an initiation at the secret court to which he is introduced by Core e' Fierro. Lucia, Gaetano's woman, feels attracted to Nicola, but the two repress their desire. Ajossa wants to get his hands on Gaetano and sets a trap for Lucia, inducing her to yield to him in order to save her lover, so that the latter, in order to avenge the offence, will make a mistake.</desc>
