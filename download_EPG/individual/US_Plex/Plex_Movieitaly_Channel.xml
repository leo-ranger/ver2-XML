In the neighbourhood, Gaetano, known as Core e' Fierro, is the absolute boss of the guapperia.

Lucia, Gaetano's woman, feels attracted to Nicola, but the two repress their desire. Ajossa wants to get his hands on Gaetano and sets a trap for Lucia, inducing her to yield to him in order to save her lover, so that the latter, in order to avenge the offence, will make a mistake.</desc>
