Merry adventures come together with entertaining insets “for crafty hands” when the audience learns how to produce all cartoon characters using paper, cardboard, scissors and glue. The project is supported with the site where all flat patterns are provided with the advices how to manufacture the paper world items.This is the way spectator gets involved into a peculiar game that brings out creative work and development of many useful practical skills, distracting kids from permanent attachment to a computer. The “Paper Tales” project is a fascinating and helpful alternative to computer-oriented pastime. The whole cartoon is accompanied by off-screen narrator’s text and exuberant flow of gags. Each episode is planned to last for 5 minutes (a version without insets – 4 minutes). Technique of performance is 3D computer graphics imitating paper application work.</desc>
