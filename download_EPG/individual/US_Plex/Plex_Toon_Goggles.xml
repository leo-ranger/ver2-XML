    <desc>Animation series “Paper Tales” narrate to children audience in fascinating way amusing adventures of paper animals – a moose named Aristotle and a woodpecker named Knock-Knock – in paper land where everything is made only from paper. Merry adventures come together with entertaining insets “for crafty hands” when the audience learns how to produce all cartoon characters using paper, cardboard, scissors and glue. The project is supported with the site where all flat patterns are provided with the advices how to manufacture the paper world items.This is the way spectator gets involved into a peculiar game that brings out creative work and development of many useful practical skills, distracting kids from permanent attachment to a computer.

Each episode is planned to last for 5 minutes (a version without insets – 4 minutes). Technique of performance is 3D computer graphics imitating paper application work.</desc>

    <title>Heroes of Envell</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Present days. Saint Petersburg. Four friends – Art, Kira, Phil and Vic are the coolest gamers in school. Eventually they find a suspicious laptop with «Heroes of Envell» game installed on it. Turns out that this very laptop is a portal to another dimension, a game realm which is full of adventures and real-life danger. The game realm is a blend of medieval, steampunk and futurism. You never know what really awaits our heroes. Just like the design of the game, the game logic is very unpredictable. You start with a quest and then it becomes a race right until it all grows into a tricky brainteaser. But be sure about one thing – there is no boring or easy way in here.
