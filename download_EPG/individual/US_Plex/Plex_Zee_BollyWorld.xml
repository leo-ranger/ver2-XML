    <title>Article 15</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Article 15 is a hard-hitting investigative drama inspired by real events, focusing on the caste-based injustices prevalent in India. When a young Dalit girl is found murdered and another goes missing, a newly posted IPS officer, Ayan Ranjan (played by Ayushmann Khurrana), takes on the case. As he digs deeper, he is faced with bureaucratic resistance, local hostility, and systemic corruption. The film, directed by Anubhav Sinha, is a powerful commentary on the social divide and is titled after the Indian Constitution's Article 15, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</desc>
