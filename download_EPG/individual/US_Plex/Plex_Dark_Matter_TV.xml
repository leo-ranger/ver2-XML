    <title>Jo AKA Cop Crime Scene Paris</title>
    <sub-title>Place Vendome</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E05</episode-num>
    <desc>"Jo' takes the audience behind the scenes of Paris’ most iconic locations, as we follow St-Clair in his relentless pursuit of justice. Brilliant and brutal, St-Clair must outwit pathological killers to solve the most shocking murders: a supermodel is thrown off the Eiffel Tower; a child-killer is found tortured to death in the doorway of Notre Dame; an heiress is brutalized during a sex romp at The Hôtel de Crillon; a jeweler is burned to death on Place Vendôme; a Sorbonne professor is poisoned in front of Opéra; a woman hunting Nazi war loot is bludgeoned to death in the Place Des Vosges. St-Clair is partnered with rookie detective Bayard, a good-looking college-educated cop whose by-the-book approach stands in marked contrast to St-Clair’s lone-wolf methods. Supervising them is Commissaire Dormont, a tough-minded boss with a long tumultuous history with St-Clair. Rounding up St-Clair’s team are sharp-tongued coroner Angelique Alassane and the eccentric but gifted forensic expert Nicolas Normand. St-Clair’s personal life is as challenging and dangerous as the cases he solves. American TV star Jill Hennessy (“Law &amp; Order”, “Crossing Jordan”, “Luck”) plays St-Clair’s adviser and friend Karyn, an unorthodox nun who works in the city’s underbelly. St-Clair’s most formidable challenge is his own daughter Adele, a young Emergency Room nurse as implacable as her father."</desc>
