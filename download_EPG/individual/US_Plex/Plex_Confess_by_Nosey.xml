    <desc>Marlene says she rented a garage apartment in a house owed by the defendant’s mother, and when her son came to the house one day, she kicked her out and said he was moving in. When she told them she needed more than a few days to move, the man deliberately flooded the place. Andrew claims he gave Marlene 30 days to vacate and she didn’t comply. In the meantime the pipe burst and flooded the place. She’s suing for damages and he’s accused of lousy land lording.</desc>
