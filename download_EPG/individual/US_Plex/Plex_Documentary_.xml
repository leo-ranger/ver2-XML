    <desc>In this episode, in 1987, Michael Ryan committed Britain‚Äôs deadliest massacre of its time, shooting 16 people and injuring 16 more. Doted on by his mother, Ryan grew up to be a spoilt loner who was - obsessed with weapons and the military, creating his own fantasy world in which he modeled himself as a courageous and dangerous action hero. Ryan would go on to carry out a deadly mission of his own making, when he murdered 16 people, including his mother, in cold blood, before finally turning the gun on himself.</desc>
