    <desc>For a generation of Afghan women, education and opportunities were a given. Growing up post-Taliban meant they enjoyed a freedom their mothers never did. But that all changed in August 2021, when the Taliban regained power in Kabul. One group of women saw what was coming and made the difficult decision to leave their home and their families and, in the dark of night, escape for the security of a better life anywhere but there. Through the harrowing first person stories of the young women who make up the Afghan Women’s Soccer team, we experience the immediate day to day and personal impact of two decades of American foreign policy decisions (and failures).</desc>

    <desc>A McDonald’s Happy Meal shortage. A security guard escort. Guns pulled in a Target parking lot. All of these are caused by a common factor: trading cards. In 2020, a new BOOM began. For the first time, large hedge funds, celebrities like Logan Paul and Steve Aoki, nostalgic millennials, entrepreneurs like Josh Luber, and billionaires scrambled to add sports, Pokémon, and other hot item cards to their collections and portfolios. Over the next two years, the hobby exploded — even causing card grading services to shut down due to overwhelming customer service. This documentary is a character-driven feel good deep dive into the high-stakes, eccentric world of card collecting, following buyers, sellers, card shop owners, graders, online streamers, auctioneers, and more, who all participate in the hobby in their own unique ways. Directed by Morgan Jon Fox.</desc>
