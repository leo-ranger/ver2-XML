    <desc>Dale Earnhardt Jr. wants Ray to help restore an El Camino, except add on a Laguna front end. It’s not a typical restoration, but it’s certainly a NASCAR performance-worthy restoration. Ray and the team build the car and then, in a bit of gamesmanship, challenge Kyle Tucker, owner of Detroit Speed, to a series of races against his award winning Camaro. But as always, Ray has an ace up his sleeve in Al Unser, Jr. as his driver.</desc>

    <desc>Everyone has a car they fell in love with. Maybe it was the first? Maybe it was the hot rod the guy down the street owned? In Ray’s case, it was the ’58 Chevy he saw in the iconic coming of age car movie, American Graffiti. When Ray gets the chance to own the car after years and years of pursuit, he jumps on it. But restoring the car to its "movie state" proves to be a grueling task that goes way beyond a typical build. But when it's you first love, you can't let her down.</desc>
