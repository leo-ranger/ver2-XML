    <episode-num system="onscreen">S12E07</episode-num>
    <desc>Stacey rolls in a Big Bad Buick Riviera and shows you what is possible with the right vehicle and some bolt on parts. This 1972 Riviera is a great entry-level project that won’t break the bank, and has the potential to serve some serious humble-pie to any unsuspecting hot shot that may want to mix it up at the stoplight. As it sits, the big 455 under the hood is a force to be reckoned with, but Stacey shows what a weekend in the garage and a top end rebuild can do for a car like this! Get ready to get your hands dirty and bust a few knuckles as Stacey pulls the old heads, intake, cam, and ignition off and replaces them with performance parts from companies like TA Performance, Edelbrock, and MSD. It’s a lesson in Buick and bolt-on horsepower, and you’re only gonna find it on GearZ.</desc>

Stacey also stops by to visit with a fellow boat tail Riviera owner and trade tips on beefing up these classic beauties. It turns out that this guy and Stacey had both been watching this same car when it came up for sale! Come hang out with us as we visit some great folks this week on GearZ.</desc>

    <desc>Stacey gets down to business on the Big Bad Buick. With the top end engine rebuilt, the exterior and interior of the car need some serious updating. You don’t have to spend a ton of cash on simple modifications. Stacey shows what’s behind making a good clean line with your bumpers and how a simple front and rear bumper tuck can drastically change the appearance. Replacing the grille and scraping off that old vinyl top are also sure-fire ways to add attitude to this big ol’ boat tail. That old carpet has got to go! Follow along as Stacey shows the ins and outs and some tips and tricks to keep your exterior and interior redo from breaking the bank.</desc>

    <desc>With our chassis and drivetrain out of the way, it’s time to get moving on the inside of the SR-71 Rapid Tool Express. But how do you organize a bunch of tools in and empty truck? Well, the guys from Summit Bodyworks do it every day on full size Cornwell tool trucks, so it’s only natural that they lend a hand in helping layout the inside our ’59 Panel to make it cool and serviceable. After that, Stacey addresses the issue of wooden floors and beds, and shows you an aluminum floor option that you’d swear came from the forest. Finally, the crew hits the road and gets a chance to talk with top fuel drag racer Leah Pritchett about her drive to become one of the best top fuelers in the nation. From design to drag racing, we’ve got it covered, this week on GearZ.</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S13E05</episode-num>
    <desc>The Jeep may be the single most modified vehicle out there. From winches to lights, doors and fenders, if you’ve got a Jeep, it probably has some accessories on it. But despite all that, one of the best things about a Jeep is the removable top. It also sparks one of the biggest debates... What is best: a soft top or a hard top? Stacey takes on the challenge by comparing a factory hard top with the new Bestop Trektop. The test will include everything from ease of install to styling, overall sound decibels and of course, how watertight it is. Hopefully you won’t get wet on this ride! Then it’s back to the shop where Stacey shows you that rotisseries aren’t just for chickens, and how an automotive rotisserie can make life in the shop a lot easier. Finally, it’s on to the right and wrong way to use weatherstrip adhesive to hold your rubbers on. Sound risqué? It’s not... it’s just GEARZ!</desc>

From its beginnings as a well-worn farm truck, you’ll see it get an upgraded suspension, interior, drivetrain, as we make it better than I was before... better... stronger... faster... wait, that was a DIFFERENT Lee Majors TV show! After that, we walk you through the paint job and show how it is similar to the Fall Guy truck, only different.... because It’s the Stunt Double!!! No hocus pocus... no movie magic... just a tough truck being built to handle the toughest stunts... only on GEARZ!</desc>

From rock-crawlers to the mall crawlers, Bestops unique past allows us to see what the future of the Jeep world will be. Finally, if you’re trying to decide between a stick or automatic transmission… hang out for a while as Stacey talks about converting your boring automatic to a lively manual transmission.

Take a trip through the last century as Stacey tracks the development of a tool company started by a blacksmith, to the tool truck empire that stresses quality over everything else. Speaking of 100 years…trucks have been around for over a century, and for over a century, truck owners have struggled to find the best way to lift their trucks. Stacey sheds some light on picking the right kind of lift for the truck you’re driving. We’ve got all of this and more on GearZ.</desc>

Tag along as Stacey gets a chance to get behind the wheel again and boil some tires.

First, every aircraft must have fins, and Stacey finally finds the fins he’s been looking for since the beginning of this build. Second, a cool logo design shows up at the shop. Third, what’s a stealthy tribute vehicle without stealthy paint? Believe it or not, Stacey’s got some paint that should keep the SR71 flying under the radar. Also, a slightly modified March Performance system will help Stacey get that much closer to putting some spark to this awesome build and stick around for plenty of other tech advice from America’s Gearhead… on GearZ.</desc>

After that, we dig into toolboxes. Hang out as Stacey talks with two engineers about what makes the new Cornwell Platinum boxes so tough. From rollers to welds, these might be the Ultimate box! Then the Cheetah is back in the garage, but only for a day or two before it heads out to get the body work finished and get some new color. It’s all here on GearZ.</desc>

Stacey walks you through the process of building your own tri-power out of old derelict parts. After that, he pulls out the big Mopar guns and shows what it takes to put together a six-pack. Then, Stacey gets down and dirty and shows you how to build some simple, ultra strong axle dollies by using some old scrap metal like the kind laying around your garage.

    <desc>Stacey puts the finishing touches on the ’07 Jeep Wrangler with off-road bumpers, body armor, and lights... and builds a very capable off-road rig that is still civil enough to be driven every day. However, just before the Rhea family takes possession of their “new” Jeep, Stacey springs a little surprise on them… He enlists them to help him squeeze a little more performance and gas mileage out of the vehicle, just to prove that anybody can do it! On go the performance air intake, computer upgrades, synthetic oil, and even some slick new seat covers. If you have been reluctant to modify your vehicle because you didn’t think you had the ability…Think again! This show proves that anybody can be a gearhead and make their vehicle better in some way. So now you have no excuse to not be working on something!</desc>

    <sub-title>Knucklebuster Chassis Rebuild</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S03E01</episode-num>
    <desc>Stacey takes a well worn, ’73 Chevy pickup that was left for dead in the late 80’s, and starts bringing it back to life by upgrading the suspension and brakes. Not only is this a project that most anybody can do, but it is the start of a three-part series of the major steps that are involved in rebuilding a vehicle. With the way the economy is and the price of new vehicles today, this show demonstrates that there is a better option than buying something new…. bust your own knuckles and build it yourself! Then Stacey sits down with off-road racing legend Ivan Stewart to find out what makes him “the Ironman”.</desc>

    <sub-title>Knucklebuster Engine Swap</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S03E02</episode-num>
    <desc>Stacey jumps back into the “KnuckleBuster” project, and deals with an area we can all relate to… a sick engine and transmission. But instead of getting rid of that old worn out vehicle, you can bring it back to life by stuffing in a new engine and transmission; Stacey walks you through the steps to show you just how easy this can be. But, you must be willing to bust your knuckles some and get your hands a little dirty! After that, Stacey puts on the gloves and shows you how to perform a little surgery on a tired rear-end to get the traction that only a locker can supply. Make sure to turn your head and cough!</desc>

    <desc>Everybody knows that the area most prone to wear and tear on your vehicle is the interior. Well, that’s OK because today Stacey shows you how to dig into one and bring it back to life without spending a fortune. Whether you just need carpet, door panels, or a complete overhaul, this is something you can do with your own two hands if you are not afraid to get dirty. Then, it’s on to the place you spend most of your time… the seat! As Stacey goes through the steps of reupholstering your old rag-tag seat, you’ll see it can be made as good as new. If you are tired of driving around with an old ratty interior and don’t know what to do, this episode of GEARZ is for you!</desc>

    <sub-title>Silver State Classic</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S03E04</episode-num>
    <desc>If there is one thing that every gearhead dreams of doing, it’s getting their car out on the open road and opening it up to see how fast it will go. Of course, there are a few things like speed limits, tickets, and jail time that keep people from doing this sort of thing. But, wouldn’t it be great if it was possible to do it just once? Well it is... and today Stacey shows you where as we showcase the last real outlaw race in the country… the Silver State Classic road race. If you have a car, and the desire to drive it fast, then there is 90 miles of wide open, two-lane highway in Nevada calling your name! Then it’s back to the GEARZ shop where Stacey addresses one of the most versatile tools you can have in your shop… the MIG welder.</desc>
