    <desc>Ol’ Smoke is back as Stacey finishes up the transformation of a brand-new ’08 Corvette, into a full-on super car capable of running with any Ferrari, Porsche, or Lamborghini. It’s a brake upgrade, along with wheels and tires and some custom airbrushing, to not only make the car even more unique, but to also get it ready for it’s new owner to enjoy. Then, Stacey takes Ol’ Smoke out and puts it through the paces showing once again that you can not only have fun building something cool, but also having just as much fun driving it when you are done. No doubt about it, somebody is going to get a special car when Armor All gives Ol’ Smoke away.</desc>

    <desc>What is the nastiest project that everyone has to do eventually? That’s right… replacing old, worn out, nasty carpeting. Stacey rolls the Banshee back in the shop and shows you how to bring a very tired interior back to life with some tips and tricks that will help in replacing those old, worn out threads with some new ones. While we are on the subject of interiors, Stacey also digs into one of the best kept secrets in auto restoration… painting a dash and door panels. If you would like to make your dash and door panels look like new again in just a few hours… for very little money… and not have the paint flake off in a few weeks in big chunks, then this is the show you have to see!</desc>

From the lowly beginnings of fragile paper elements... to the massive, top secret facilities of industry powers like K&amp;N, the air filter has a heritage that was born and bred on the race track! Then, Stacey digs into one of the neatest tools you’ll ever see and one that every metal worker should own… the Power Hammer. If you are interested in shaping metal and building your own panels, then you need to see this in action.</desc>

    <desc>Stacey puts the finishing touches on the ’07 Jeep Wrangler with off-road bumpers, body armor, and lights... and builds a very capable off-road rig that is still civil enough to be driven every day. However, just before the Rhea family takes possession of their “new” Jeep, Stacey springs a little surprise on them… He enlists them to help him squeeze a little more performance and gas mileage out of the vehicle, just to prove that anybody can do it! On go the performance air intake, computer upgrades, synthetic oil, and even some slick new seat covers. If you have been reluctant to modify your vehicle because you didn’t think you had the ability…Think again! This show proves that anybody can be a gearhead and make their vehicle better in some way. So now you have no excuse to not be working on something!</desc>

    <desc>Stacey takes a well worn, ’73 Chevy pickup that was left for dead in the late 80’s, and starts bringing it back to life by upgrading the suspension and brakes. Not only is this a project that most anybody can do, but it is the start of a three-part series of the major steps that are involved in rebuilding a vehicle. With the way the economy is and the price of new vehicles today, this show demonstrates that there is a better option than buying something new…. bust your own knuckles and build it yourself! Then Stacey sits down with off-road racing legend Ivan Stewart to find out what makes him “the Ironman”.</desc>

But instead of getting rid of that old worn out vehicle, you can bring it back to life by stuffing in a new engine and transmission; Stacey walks you through the steps to show you just how easy this can be. But, you must be willing to bust your knuckles some and get your hands a little dirty! After that, Stacey puts on the gloves and shows you how to perform a little surgery on a tired rear-end to get the traction that only a locker can supply. Make sure to turn your head and cough!</desc>

Of course, there are a few things like speed limits, tickets, and jail time that keep people from doing this sort of thing. But, wouldn’t it be great if it was possible to do it just once? Well it is... and today Stacey shows you where as we showcase the last real outlaw race in the country… the Silver State Classic road race. If you have a car, and the desire to drive it fast, then there is 90 miles of wide open, two-lane highway in Nevada calling your name!

First, by “grabbing” a Challenger in a most unorthodox way and then comparing it head-to-head with a 70’ 440 six-pack car. But that’s not all… Then Stacey decides to take the new car beyond the legend by sticking on a supercharger and really blowing the doors off of the competition!

But wait!... you can’t cut out the shock towers can you!?! Yes you can!... and Stacey goes in-depth on not only how to do it, but also the installation of a complete TCI independent front suspension. If you own or want to own a classic Mustang, Cougar, Fairlane, or other 60’s Ford and have always wished you could get rid of those stock shock towers to get more room in the engine compartment, this is the show for you.</desc>

    <desc>Everybody knows that the Jeep is an amazing vehicle, and people use them for everything from daily drivers to hard-core off-roaders. The question is, can you do both with the same vehicle? Stacey shows you that it’s possible, as he takes a very stock Jeep JK and slaps on a lift, wheels and tires, and other essential parts and begins to create a rig that is just as comfortable on the road as it is on the trail. With today’s economy, it’s all about getting the best bang for the buck and this show will show you how to do that. Then we dig into the unique world of Mickey Thompson, and see not only his influence in the creation of off-road racing, but also how he continues to influence the off-road and racing tire markets today.</desc>

    <desc>It’s back! It’s done!! AND it’s WILD! The Banshee comes full circle as Stacey walks you thru the complete buildup of this incredible V8 powered Miata, and then takes it out for a good flogging!

If you’ve always considered the Mazda Miata a girl’s car…you HAVE to check this out! If you think that it’s impossible to have a reliable car with power windows, Air conditioning, and a real working top, that is ALSO blisteringly FAST…YOU HAVE TO CHECK THIS OUT! The best part is this is a car you can actually build and afford…and that’s what real Hot Rodding is all about!</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S05E11</episode-num>
    <desc>Stacey rolls the Ram 1500 Express back in the shop and starts to transform it into the Drag’N’ Wagon. Pulling on the legacy of the iconic Superbee, the Little Red Wagon wheelstander, and the current popularity of Dragon folklore, Stacey sets out to create a modern street machine from a lowly base pickup that anybody can afford. To get the rig to handle, a state-of-the-art air suspension is installed, along with massive brakes, and cool performance wheels and tires. One thing about this wagon…..it’s going to handle!!!! After that, it’s off to the dyno to see what kind of difference a spark plug can make in the performance of your engine.</desc>

    <desc>Stacey rolls in an old ’67 Ford pickup that has been hacked on over the years, and shows how to get rid of the old afterthought floor shifter, and convert it to a column shift that will actually shift gears! After that, Stacey digs into one of the newest fuel injection units on the market and shows how easy it is to install, and then demonstrates how to shave the drip rail off of your muscle car. Finally, we answer the question: Is it possible to put chrome plating on aluminum or stainless steel? We take a trip to Advance plating in Nashville to find out. There’s so much stuff going on, you’re gonna need to watch this show twice!</desc>

    <sub-title>Breathing Fire into the Drag’N’Wagon – The New Face of Slot Cars/Carrera</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S06E02</episode-num>
    <desc>Today on GEARZ, Stacey brings back the Drag’N’Wagon to see if he can get the beast to breathe some fire! The first thing he puts on is an ATI supercharger system to get some air sucking in. Then adds some hotter coils to help light the flame…and finally slaps on a bigger exhaust system to help blow the air out. If you are wondering how to make a street beast out of an entry level truck, this show spells it out. Then it’s on to the world of slot cars, as Stacey explores the past, present, and future of the little motorized miniatures that helped shape the gearhead world as we know it and introduces you to Carrera slot cars.</desc>

    <desc>Today on GEARZ, Stacey jumps into a project that’s bound to get everybody talking…a SUPERCAR that will run with the Ferraris and Lamborghinis that are out there. But, before he can show you HOW to build one, he has to show you how the whole supercar thing came into existence, and what it takes to build something that will run over 200mph…safely! If you’ve ever dreamed of owning a super car, and thought you couldn’t afford it…… this is a show you can’t afford to miss!</desc>

    <desc>One of the hottest new rigs on the market is the Ford F150 with the new 6 cylinder eco-boost engine. But is it all it can be? Well, today on GEARZ Stacey takes a new eco-boost powered Ford and shows you some simple upgrades that can boost performance AND fuel economy of this great new engine…..at a price you can afford.
