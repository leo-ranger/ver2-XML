    <desc>Matt is out for revenge. Last year Dale beat him badly at the Annual Vintage bike race in Barber, Alabama. But this year there is a whole new tale to tell. With just days until the race - Dale is secretly struggling to get the bike he beat Matt with last year up and working. Matt struggles just to locate a 100-year old bike. Matt's prayers are answered thanks to an old Catholic Priest he located who has possession of a bike. The priest might let Matt have the bike to race - but there are conditions. The toughest one: Don't tell Dale you have it. Can Matt afford to buy the bike and get it running in time for the race without Dale seeing it? Will Dale even get his broken bike started? And if they ever get to race, will Matt exact his revenge?</desc>

    <desc>Built in the mid-60’s by eccentric engineer “Wild Bill” Gelbke, the Road Dog was, and still is, the largest motorcycle ever built. It utilized aircraft tubing, Corvette disc brakes, and a Chevy truck differential to keep it stable. The one-off creation disappeared when Gelbke did in 1978. Outflanked once when the bike was spotted and sold to a private collector in 1995, Dale has vowed to locate the machine and make Wheels Through Time its final resting place.</desc>

    <desc>For Dale and Matt sometimes the dotted line to treasure splits and heads in opposite directions. In this edition of What’s in the Barn, time is thrust to the forefront of this multi-state, long distance, north, south search. Timeless and priceless 110 year old bikes, antique cars, airplanes, and the infamous Egberts 1930 neon Harley-Davidson sign that coined the phrase “Ride a Winner” are high on this father and son’s list of “must haves”. The clock ticks, both literally and figuratively, on one rare time piece and two old-timer’s cars, bikes, and automobiles.</desc>
