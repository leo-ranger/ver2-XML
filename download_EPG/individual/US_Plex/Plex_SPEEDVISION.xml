    <sub-title>Setting up the Ultimate Trailer – Towing Tech</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S05E07</episode-num>
    <desc>If there’s one thing that every gearhead needs, it’s a trailer so you can drag more junk home! The problem is, most of us don’t really put much thought into the set up of a trailer, and that can add up to some serious problems when you go to retrieve your prize. Today on GEARZ, Stacey walks you thru how to set up a simple trailer, so you’ll be ready to pull a rusted hulk out of a field, or pull a restoration from coast to coast. Compressed air, Winch, and auxiliary electric power are all things that you CAN take with you if you take the time to plan ahead and select the right equipment so it all works together. If you like to hunt for those forgotten treasures, a trailer is one tool you’ve got to have!</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S05E08</episode-num>
    <desc>Two of the biggest complaints that people have about the new Car manufacturers today, is that they don’t build the cars and trucks people want, and what they do build is too expensive. Well, never fear because today on GEARZ, Stacey introduces the new Ram 1500 Express that has a 390 horsepower 5.7 Hemi in a short bed, regular cab truck, and an price tag that will have you rubbing your eyes and pinching yourself to see if it is true. Better yet, there is a huge aftermarket out there to help you build a one of a kind vehicle. In 1968, Plymouth stood the muscle car world on its ear with the incredible Road Runner. In 2011,Mopar has done it again with the Ram 1500 Express…and GEARZ has the very first one… BEEP…BEEP!!!</desc>

    <desc>When it comes to America, we all know who the founding Fathers are, and what their vision was for this Nation. When it comes to Hot Rodding, a lot of people have no idea who the founders are, and how this all got started. Today on GEARZ, Stacey gives you an up-close and personal look at the legendary, “Speedy” Bill Smith and the incredible world of Speedway Motors. Not only were they there from the beginning in the early ‘50’s, but they are still on the cutting edge and pulse of the Hot Rodding world. How do they do it???? You’ll have to watch and find out! After that, Stacey takes a look at the wild ’68 Camaro that Cherry Bomb has put together, to serve as their new way to disturb the Peace. CRANK IT UP!!!!</desc>

    <desc>Stacey rolls the Ram 1500 Express back in the shop and starts to transform it into the Drag’N’ Wagon. Pulling on the legacy of the iconic Superbee, the Little Red Wagon wheelstander, and the current popularity of Dragon folklore, Stacey sets out to create a modern street machine from a lowly base pickup that anybody can afford. To get the rig to handle, a state-of-the-art air suspension is installed, along with massive brakes, and cool performance wheels and tires. One thing about this wagon…..it’s going to handle!!!! After that, it’s off to the dyno to see what kind of difference a spark plug can make in the performance of your engine.</desc>

    <desc>Today on GEARZ, Stacey brings back the Drag’N’Wagon to see if he can get the beast to breathe some fire! The first thing he puts on is an ATI supercharger system to get some air sucking in. Then adds some hotter coils to help light the flame…and finally slaps on a bigger exhaust system to help blow the air out. If you are wondering how to make a street beast out of an entry level truck, this show spells it out. Then it’s on to the world of slot cars, as Stacey explores the past, present, and future of the little motorized miniatures that helped shape the gearhead world as we know it and introduces you to Carrera slot cars.</desc>

    <desc>With all the makeovers going on these days, it may surprise you to find that there ARE groups out there that could REALLY use some help. The local volunteer Fire Department is a perfect example of this. Since they are volunteers, nobody gets paid the put their life on the line day in and day out, and the equipment they use is generally hand-me-down stuff from the bigger Fire Departments. Well today on GEARZ, Stacey decides to do something about that by taking a stock Chevy dually pickup, and transform it into a state-of-the-art Brush truck for the local Volunteer Fire Department. The cool thing is, he’s using a lot of aftermarket parts that YOU can use on your project…And if it’s good enough for Firemen that go into harm’s way, you KNOW it is good enough for what you will use it for. So strap in, and let’s go ride a Fire Truck!</desc>

If you ever wanted to thrash your Dad’s old Wagon, this is the show for you! After that Stacey digs into some of the most asked questions regarding shooting waterborne paint, and finally we take a trip to Texas to see how one body-man created his own business by selling tools, instead of using them.

    <sub-title>Long Bed Into Short Bed</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S07E03</episode-num>
    <desc>Everybody wants a classic short bed pickup. Unfortunately, short beds are hard to find for a good price… but long beds are a dime-a-dozen, and cheap! The solution?... chop a long bed down! That is exactly what Stacey does on this episode of GEARZ. He takes a classic 67 Chevy long bed, and walks you through the way to cut the frame properly, so you have a safe and reliable truck when you are done. If you’ve heard about this kind of modification, but always thought it was too difficult or involved for you to do, you need to watch this episode of GEARZ and let the cutting begin!</desc>

    <desc>Who put men on the moon? If you answered “Gearheads” then you are right… of course, we call them engineers and rocket scientists now. But that doesn’t change the fact that a bunch of hot rodders figured out how to get America into Space, and Stacey takes a look at the roots of the Space Program, and the invention of the moon buggy. Then it’s out to the NASA testing grounds to see the annual Moon buggy race. If you think you’ve seen some weird projects, wait until you see what some of these young minds have dreamed up. You may think you’re on another planet, but you’re not… you’re watching GEARZ!</desc>

That’s right, with the cutting done, the next step is to assemble a new short bed using all new aftermarket parts. You hear people say, “if it was that easy, everybody would be doing it!” Well, it IS that easy, and a lot of people ARE doing it… and YOU need to be one of them! Now… chop to it!</desc>

But the legend didn’t end in the 1940’s… it continues on as Stacey showcases the new P-38 engine parts from Jon Kaase that you can put on your small block Ford to make it run like greased lightning! After that, Stacey sits down with Rock and Roll legend and certified car nut, James Burton, to dig into the unique connection between cars, guitars, and Rock and roll. Turn it on… crank it up… and hold on!</desc>

Stacey walks through the simple steps on how to care for those tools, so they give you years of trouble free service. After that, He goes through the many parts you will need to put a manual transmission into a project, with Transmission Tech. Finally, if you’re looking for a simple project to do over the weekend, how about a muffler swap? You say “no”?... Stacey says “yes.”</desc>

    <desc>The V8 Interceptor is BACK and wearing a striking coat of glossy black paint! How did it happen? Well, Stacey walks you through the process and shows off the incredible paint and body work that was done by the Hot Rod Institute. From the subtle body nips and tucks, to the major fabrication of a new roof, this classic Cougar now has a straighter body than anything that may have rolled off the assembly line in 1967! But the paint is only half the story, as Stacey starts to re-assemble the car with bumpers, lights and engine, you start to get a good look at what is rapidly becoming the ultimate street predator!</desc>

Stacey proves that point by rolling Heavy Metal back into the GEARZ shop to outfit it with new electric winches, and an amazing custom tool box and light bar. This ’69 International cabover truck may have been rescued from a junkyard, but it won’t be long before this truck starts pulling off rescues of its own! This is recycling at it’s best! Then ride along with Stacey and crew as they travel to Minnesota and get the story on Edwards Manufacturing and how they have managed to stay in business for over a hundred years building simple tools.

But this rig belongs to John Godwin of Duck Commander, which means the truck will be spending some serious time on the road… and off… hunting for ducks. On goes a 6” lift, 35” tall tires, and massive bumpers and winch to pull this big white beast out of any mud holes it may end up in. And since it IS such a big white beast, it is only fitting that Stacey name this project “Moby Duck”! If you’ve ever wondered if it’s possible to have a daily driver, that can also be a nice hunting, fishing, or outdoor rig. This episode of GEARZ will show you how to do it.</desc>

Accessories, transmission, overdrive, headers, the list may seem to go on forever, but it’s all about finding the right parts in the aftermarket, to build the car that YOU want. After that it’s off to the races to see if E3’s new top fuel spark plug can handle the pressure of competition. If you want to see the ins and outs of building a car, GEARZ is the show to see!</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S08E13</episode-num>
    <desc>If you could only do one upgrade on your vehicle, that would make the biggest impact on the looks and drivability, what would it be? Stacey answers that question by installing a Katzkin leather interior into a Jeep Compass, and showing that if you’ve got an open weekend and a few hundred bucks, you can do the same thing on your car or truck. After that, he jumps back onto the Street Sweeper project to lay out the interior and the rearend, and finally drop that huge Hemi into place. If you’ve ever thought it would be fun to build a sleeper car, this is one ’73 Plymouth Satellite that shows how it can be done!</desc>

    <desc>Stacey tackles power gains at the air intake, modifies the computer and replaces the stock exhaust before addressing a 2” front-end suspension lift kit. He moves on to give the truck some extra height and support in the rear of the truck where payload weight can be a serious issue. After the suspension is in place, new wheels and tires bring the truck back down to the ground. Stacey also covers several tools that will help you get that old exhaust out from under your vehicle.</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S09E05</episode-num>
    <desc>Stacey tells the story of the legendary Cheetah and how that car was designed to beat Shelby’s famed Cobra. The GEARZ hunt for this iconic race car features the original ’63 Cheetah that Budd Clusserath drove 215 mph at Daytona in ‘64. But the story doesn’t end there, because Stacey gets his hands on a Cheetah Evolution and shows you how to build your own version of this tire shredding cat! After that, you’ll see Steering wheel options from Grant, a serpentine belt system from LMC Truck, and Wizard products to make your vehicle come alive, as well as a quick tip to get things rolling in your shop. All this and more on GearZ.</desc>

    <desc>Moving deeper into the build of the Cheetah Evolution, Stacey and the crew pull the skin off this cat and start putting in the guts. Overviews of suspension, steering, and brakes get this project up and running. Moving into the heart of this beast, Stacey shows us that good things do come in small packages—the LSX 454 small block is sure to get your pulse rate up. And once the transmission is mounted, look out! Headers follow, and this cat is almost ready to run. Stacey’s tool tech will give you a lift… all this and more on GearZ.</desc>
