    <desc>An family farm in the mid-west contains houses, barns, outbuildings, trailers, grain silos and buses full of old stuff and perhaps the biggest stash of undiscovered old motorcycles in the country. The collection was put together by their unnamed father. Seller agrees to have Dale broker rare Excelsior for high-end client. Dale has the buyer, but will he outbid his own client for the exclusive find?</desc>

    <desc>Matt is out for revenge. Last year Dale beat him badly at the Annual Vintage bike race in Barber, Alabama. But this year there is a whole new tale to tell. With just days until the race - Dale is secretly struggling to get the bike he beat Matt with last year up and working. Matt struggles just to locate a 100-year old bike. Matt's prayers are answered thanks to an old Catholic Priest he located who has possession of a bike. The priest might let Matt have the bike to race - but there are conditions. The toughest one: Don't tell Dale you have it. Can Matt afford to buy the bike and get it running in time for the race without Dale seeing it? Will Dale even get his broken bike started? And if they ever get to race, will Matt exact his revenge?</desc>

    <desc>Built in the mid-60’s by eccentric engineer “Wild Bill” Gelbke, the Road Dog was, and still is, the largest motorcycle ever built. It utilized aircraft tubing, Corvette disc brakes, and a Chevy truck differential to keep it stable. The one-off creation disappeared when Gelbke did in 1978. Outflanked once when the bike was spotted and sold to a private collector in 1995, Dale has vowed to locate the machine and make Wheels Through Time its final resting place.</desc>

    <desc>For Dale and Matt sometimes the dotted line to treasure splits and heads in opposite directions. In this edition of What’s in the Barn, time is thrust to the forefront of this multi-state, long distance, north, south search. Timeless and priceless 110 year old bikes, antique cars, airplanes, and the infamous Egberts 1930 neon Harley-Davidson sign that coined the phrase “Ride a Winner” are high on this father and son’s list of “must haves”. The clock ticks, both literally and figuratively, on one rare time piece and two old-timer’s cars, bikes, and automobiles.</desc>

Her husband reveals the incredible restoration that brought the earliest Mustang ever sold back to its 60’s glory. (Ford Motor Company knows she has the car and has verified it was sold before it was legal to sell.) John Grafelman is a farmer in Illinois and life-long Ford lover. A few years ago he found an old car hidden in a barn. It took some time, but he eventually convinced his friend to sell it to him. After some detective work, he discovers he purchased 1968 Ford Design Chief Larry Shinoda’s personal car that he tinkered with to invent the BOSS 302.Lastly, Ray travels to Dayton Ohio to interview Gale Holderman, the Ford stylist who won the company’s contest to draw and design the Mustang.</desc>

    <sub-title>FORGOTTEN FIBERGLASS</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S02E07</episode-num>
    <desc>Post-World War II, a large generation of American soldiers was looking for cars that mirrored the incredible sports cars they saw overseas in Europe. After searching for an affordable way to recreate these cars, one manufacturer responded with a durable, cost effective option: a line of fiberglass sports cars. Very few of these cars still exist but there are collectors who are constantly looking to save parts and pieces of these virtually unknown vehicles. We learn about these rare cars from Geoff Hacker and his team at Forgotten Fiberglass, and take a visit to the Smithsonian Museum, which houses a fiberglass car of its own. This episode presents a unique look at how the narrative of American wartime experiences often shaped the nation’s automotive demands.</desc>

    <sub-title>DISCOVERIES IN JERSEY</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S02E08</episode-num>
    <desc>Ray explores buying a unique, hand built car the Schultz family has kept in their New Jersey home for years. The car was originally called the Schultz El Fierro but it’s officially titled in New Jersey as a “Schultz Special” from 1958. It was used to drag race and held numerous racing records, but most important to the family was that it was driven by the legendary Carroll Shelby. With a frame and style much similar to the Shelby Roadster, the Schultz family wonders if it inspired one of the most well known automobiles in America. In another epic New Jersey story, Ray finds Mario Andretti’s 1965 IndyCar. The catch: it’s completely in pieces hidden away in a garage. The iconic driver talks about his days on the track with that car and Ray attempts to negotiate a deal to buy the parts.</desc>
