    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>A Jaguar that is able to terrify the world alone with its roar. This Jaguar F-Type R tuned by Arden is a real bad boy. Already in the series production configuration, the F-Type R Coupe is a dream car that can really bite but this Jaguar which has been upgraded from Arden, now calls itself "AJ23“ and is more powerful, louder and more aggressive than any of his brothers.</desc>
