Reports of knocks, bangs, disconnected voices, apparitions feelings of sickness and sadness have all been documented. It is said by locals that this house is very much alive, it breaths it sleeps and connects with all that enter. Tonight the team will try to uncover its secrets. Welcome to is it haunted?</desc>
