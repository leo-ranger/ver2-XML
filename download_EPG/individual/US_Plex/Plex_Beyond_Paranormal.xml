    <desc>The Allies defeated the Axis Powers on the battlefield, but did they actually win the war?

Further, these researchers claim that dozens of high ranking Nazi scientists, intelligence officers and generals were exfiltrated into the United States through Operation Paper Clip where they were placed in powerful and highly influential positions atop the US power structure. Finally, these researchers/historians claim, these Nazi's and their descendants continue to exercise considerable influence on world events to the present day.</desc>
