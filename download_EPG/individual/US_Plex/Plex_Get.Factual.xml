    <title>Dracula - The True Story of Vampires</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>How did the ancient myth of the vampire emerge? When did the first “vampire epidemic” break out? And who inspired Bram Stoker to write his famous novel “Dracula”? Yet vampires made headlines long before Stoker’s novel was published. The fear of the undead returning from their graves striking terror into people’s hearts is as old as the world.</desc>

    <title>Scandinavia's Hidden Paradises</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Scandinavia has always been a place of longing. Once covered by a kilometre-thick layer of ice, more than 100,000 years ago a mighty giant rose from the sea in the north of Europe, whose immense nature continues to fascinate people today. The Scandinavian Peninsula and the surrounding Nordic countries impress with numerous superlatives: the largest continental glacier, the deepest fjord in Europe, four UNESCO World Natural Heritage sites and more than 200,000 islands in Sweden alone.</desc>

    <desc>Where in Europe are bisons still to be found in the wild? And where do probably more migratory birds breed than in any other European country? The flora and fauna of Poland are full of surprises: the South is dominated by the 2000m peaks of the Tatra, to the North-East the Biebrza river forms one of the largest swamp regions of Europe, a paradise for rare birds like the ruff.</desc>

    <title>Signs of Evil - The Runes of the SS</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The symbol of the SS, Hitler’s Schutzstaffel, stands for terror and the murder of millions. The penniless graphic artist Walter Heck was given the job of designing the jagged, rune-like characters in 1929. The “sig” rune was rooted deep in the ideological cosmos of the Nazis and their supporters. They saw themselves as the descendants of the Teutons and declared the runes to be humanity’s original Germanic script. The symbol was meant to unite Heinrich Himmler’s “Black Order.” But did it escape their notice that it was originally of Semitic origin? In October 1945, the Allies passed a law banning the Nazi Party and all associated organizations, including the SS. The young Federal Republic even forbade all Nazi symbols. This documentary tells the gripping story of the SS symbol, from the Middle Ages to the present day.</desc>

    <desc>A nation of seafarers and merchants, the Vikings revolutionised exploration and trading in the Middle Ages and discovered America 500 years before Columbus. This gripping film unveils their bad reputation as wild, murdering and pillaging norsemen as misguided and reveals a strikingly tolerant people with an elaborate trading network that stretched right through Europe. For 900 years, their light, manoeuvrable sailing-ships could not be matched. As the best seafarers of their time, daring, tolerant explorers and expert merchants, they set new benchmarks and left their mark everywhere.</desc>

    <title>Signs of Evil - The Runes of the SS</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The symbol of the SS, Hitler’s Schutzstaffel, stands for terror and the murder of millions. The penniless graphic artist Walter Heck was given the job of designing the jagged, rune-like characters in 1929. The “sig” rune was rooted deep in the ideological cosmos of the Nazis and their supporters. They saw themselves as the descendants of the Teutons and declared the runes to be humanity’s original Germanic script. The symbol was meant to unite Heinrich Himmler’s “Black Order.” But did it escape their notice that it was originally of Semitic origin? In October 1945, the Allies passed a law banning the Nazi Party and all associated organizations, including the SS. The young Federal Republic even forbade all Nazi symbols. This documentary tells the gripping story of the SS symbol, from the Middle Ages to the present day.</desc>
