    <title>The Story of Europe</title>
    <sub-title>Commonalities and Division</sub-title>
    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E02</episode-num>
    <desc>Europe has been a battle concept for centuries: it often takes foreign enemies to weld the Europeans together. But for centuries, they are primarily fighting against themselves. It was not until the Enlightenment and the French Revolution of 1789 that a new idea of Europe emerged based on common values: freedom, equality and fraternalism.</desc>

    <title>China's Schindlers</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>These are two stories rarely told that should never be forgotten: The stories of China’s Schindlers - two courageous men who stood up for human decency as evil engulfed the world. Chinese diplomat Dr. Feng Shan Ho was Consul-General in Vienna, Austria in the late 1930s. Disturbed by the Nazis’ persecution of Viennese Jews, Feng Shan Ho gave visas to Jews desperate enough to escape Hitler, and that allowed them to immigrate to Shanghai when no other nation would accept them. German businessman John Rabe lived in China for 30 years. In 1937, after Japanese troops invaded his adopted city of Nanking, Rabe could not bear to witness the horrors and atrocities around him. Under the protection of the Nazi flag, he led the establishment of a Safety Zone protecting 200,000 innocent Chinese. Diaries &amp; letters left behind are among some of the only evidence left of those who endured unspeakable horrors and bravely sacrificed for their fellow man. Those diaries, along with the voices of survivors tell not only of the darkness and terror, but also of the heroism, bravery and sacrifice of a few individuals whose character and courage stand as beacons of the human spirit. We illustrate the complex nature of the political positions of Germany, Japan, and China during WWII, highlighting Germany's acknowledgement of its wartime actions in an effort to heal relationships with the Jewish people and other neighboring countries. Experts discuss the positive impact that this has had on Germany socially and economically and how this strategy could benefit the Japanese and Chinese economic partnership and promote friendship in future generations. The West often overlooks China in the story of WWII. The Chinese people suffered horrors and atrocities that still haunt survivors. They bear witness to past brutality and endure emotional wounds that have never healed.</desc>

    <title>The Secret File of Marco Polo</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Did Marco Polo, the most illustrious traveller in history, ever go to China? A dispute lingers to this day; with some scholars still doubting whether the Venetian’s book is a genuine personal account of China’s 13th-century Middle Kingdom and its marvels. Scientists, western scholars and Chinese historians have uncovered striking new proof that the son of Venetian merchants actually had been in China. We accompany them on their quest from Venice to Beijing, to Yangzhou and Quanzhou, from the gravestones of Italian merchant families to Chinese chronicles documenting the presence of one ‘Boluo’ at the imperial court, to famous buildings described by Marco Polo and to the ‘salt men’ of China who still apply the techniques that were used seven hundred years ago. This is a journey of opulent vistas, re-enacting Marco Polo’s experiences in 13th-century China and sheds light on the pivotal role, played by an obscure writer of chivalric novels, in producing the manuscript of the Travels of Marco Polo.</desc>
