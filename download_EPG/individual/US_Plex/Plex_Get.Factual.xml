    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>In 2016, a historic moment arrived when Barack Obama spoke in Cuba to the inhabitants of the island nation and promised a future together. For the first time in more than 50 years, an American president had entered the communist country and turned towards an erstwhile enemy. However, the US economic embargo against Cuba continues. It sanctions the socialist state – although the UN General Assembly recently again called it a violation of international law. Many Cubans are therefore sceptical about a new political future, despite the friendly words of the American President. Their distrust is deep. It is based on over fifty years of history and the policies of the United States towards their country. For years, the Cuban government has raised serious allegations against their big neighbour. The film "Operation Peter Pan" tracks these allegations.</desc>

    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The mountains of the Caucasus form a magical border between Europe and Asia. Film-maker Henry M. Mix and his crew spent over a year in Russia's highest mountains. The result is an impressive documentary about the natural wonders to be found between the Black and Caspian Seas. The wild mountain landscape with its extreme climate has created a unique world of flora and fauna and makes the Caucasus one of the world's 25 most significant centres of biodiversity. Mountain bison, Caucasus Snowcock and tur are only found here. In the rain shadow of the snow-covered main ridge live Saiga antelopes, long-eared hedgehogs and short-toed snake eagles. Epic footage, breath-taking aerial photography and hitherto unseen behaviour of rare animals - Greater Caucasus has its viewers spellbound from the first minute on.</desc>
