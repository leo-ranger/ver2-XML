    <title>The Secret of the Phaistos Code</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Is the Phaistos Disc a clever fake? The film follows the trail of possibly one of the greatest archaeological scandals ever. The search for the truth starts in the ancient Cretan palace complexes of Phaistos. The North American art dealer Jerome Eisenberg, one of the world’s foremost forgery experts, considers the “Phaistos Disc” to be a latter-day fake. In 1908, it was discovered by the Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier. Since then, the disc has aroused the scientific ambition of countless linguists. The British academic Gareth Owens has analyzed new archaeological discoveries with unfamiliar characters and believes the disc to be genuine. But Eisenberg remains convinced that the disc cannot be deciphered at all. He claims that not only does it not reveal a text that has ever been decipherable, but also that is not even of ancient origin.</desc>

    <title>The Lesser Caucasus - Between Ararat and the Caspian Sea</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The mountain worlds of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mark the border between Europe and Asia. After their documentary about the Greater Caucasus, Henry J. Mix and his team have now prepared a second film about the impressive mountain world of this region. The species and landscape diversity of the lesser Caucasus are portrayed in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Shielded from the more than 4000-metre-tall main ridge of the Greater Caucasus, a thermophilic flora and fauna was able to develop in the Lesser Caucasus. For the first time, the astonishing variety of the land bridge between Europe and Persia is portrayed comprehensively. From the mountains of Dagestan, down to the canyons of the Caspian Basin, through the steppes of Azerbaijan and up into the Armenian highlands, all before the majestic backdrop of biblical Mount Ararat.</desc>

    <desc>At the outset of the 80s, the Soviet army is universally modernized. The renovation of its armored divisions is well underway, observed closely by western military intelligence in East Germany. At center stage: their T 80 tanks and Mil Mi-28 combat helicopters.

    <title>The Spark That Ignited it all - a History of Fireworks</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Colourful sparks, loud bangs, chilling explosions, awed crowds and terrified enemies … it’s all part of the long history of explosives dating back thousands of years to ancient China. They’ve been used to frighten off Mongolian invaders, support the status of kings, tell stories, entertain, intimidate and subjugate people, help produce heroes and – as a special twist – kill. Pyrotechnics have fascinated people ever since the first spark was lit. They started out as a noisy instrument of war, but as they’ve become bigger, louder and more colourful, their power has shifted. The secret weapon of the Chinese turned into the first visual mass-medium in history … and the driving force of European progress.</desc>

    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>In January 2012, Italian divers discovered the wreck of a massive plane off the coast of Sardinia.
