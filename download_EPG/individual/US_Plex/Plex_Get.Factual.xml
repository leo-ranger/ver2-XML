    <title>The Antarctica Challenge - A Global Warning</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Filmmaker Mark Terry leads an expedition to Antarctica to report on the new discoveries made by the world’s scientific community stationed in Antarctica during International Polar Years (March, 2007 to March, 2009). This award-winning documentary will provide support interviews from polar experts and research scientists around the world as well as rare footage of wildlife. It reveals many startling new scientific revelations such as penguin suicide, new vegetation growing in the world’s largest desert, diminishing populations of land animals and marine life and the dangerously increasing melting of Antarctica’s land ice. These new discoveries were considered so valuable that this film became the only one invited by the United Nations tom screen to world leaders during the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, December, 2009.</desc>

    <title>Expedition to Eternal Ice</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>In the spring of 1930, when Alfred Wegener sets off on his third Greenland expedition, he hopes it will be the crowning glory of his career. Just a few years earlier he created a furore when he published his theory of continental drift; now he intends to revolutionise climatic research. For a whole year he and his team will compile data from high in the atmosphere and deep in the ice sheet. This is to be the first long-term climatic study ever carried out, and it marks the beginning of modern climatic research. Some of the scientists will venture far into the interior of the country and even set up a research station on the ice. This, the aptly named Inland Ice, will be 400 km away from the base camp on the West Coast, and specially constructed motorised propeller sleds will be used to transport not only the construction materials for the station but also provisions to see them through the long winter. Wegener has planned the expedition meticulously, down to the tiniest detail – but things don't turn out as he hoped. Right at the start the weather upsets his calculations. He loses six valuable weeks, and it then emerges that the propeller sleds don't work properly. They will have to resort to dog sleds for all their transportation needs. Despite the unfavourable circumstances, the scientists begin work in the middle of the ice sheet… even though they don't have enough provisions for the winter. Supplies are to be brought out to them later, but then the weather takes a dramatic turn for the worse, and Alfred Wegener and his men are faced with a race against time, their very lives at stake. A race they will ultimately lose.</desc>

    <title>China's Schindlers</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>These are two stories rarely told that should never be forgotten: The stories of China’s Schindlers - two courageous men who stood up for human decency as evil engulfed the world. Chinese diplomat Dr. Feng Shan Ho was Consul-General in Vienna, Austria in the late 1930s. Disturbed by the Nazis’ persecution of Viennese Jews, Feng Shan Ho gave visas to Jews desperate enough to escape Hitler, and that allowed them to immigrate to Shanghai when no other nation would accept them. German businessman John Rabe lived in China for 30 years. In 1937, after Japanese troops invaded his adopted city of Nanking, Rabe could not bear to witness the horrors and atrocities around him. Under the protection of the Nazi flag, he led the establishment of a Safety Zone protecting 200,000 innocent Chinese. Diaries &amp; letters left behind are among some of the only evidence left of those who endured unspeakable horrors and bravely sacrificed for their fellow man. Those diaries, along with the voices of survivors tell not only of the darkness and terror, but also of the heroism, bravery and sacrifice of a few individuals whose character and courage stand as beacons of the human spirit. We illustrate the complex nature of the political positions of Germany, Japan, and China during WWII, highlighting Germany's acknowledgement of its wartime actions in an effort to heal relationships with the Jewish people and other neighboring countries. Experts discuss the positive impact that this has had on Germany socially and economically and how this strategy could benefit the Japanese and Chinese economic partnership and promote friendship in future generations. The West often overlooks China in the story of WWII. The Chinese people suffered horrors and atrocities that still haunt survivors. They bear witness to past brutality and endure emotional wounds that have never healed.</desc>
