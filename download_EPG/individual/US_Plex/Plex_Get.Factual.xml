    <title>Signs of Evil - The Runes of the SS</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The symbol of the SS, Hitler’s Schutzstaffel, stands for terror and the murder of millions. The penniless graphic artist Walter Heck was given the job of designing the jagged, rune-like characters in 1929. The “sig” rune was rooted deep in the ideological cosmos of the Nazis and their supporters. They saw themselves as the descendants of the Teutons and declared the runes to be humanity’s original Germanic script. The symbol was meant to unite Heinrich Himmler’s “Black Order.” But did it escape their notice that it was originally of Semitic origin? In October 1945, the Allies passed a law banning the Nazi Party and all associated organizations, including the SS. The young Federal Republic even forbade all Nazi symbols. This documentary tells the gripping story of the SS symbol, from the Middle Ages to the present day.</desc>

    <desc>150 years ago Alfred Wallace used his observations on Indonesian islands to develop a theory of evolution independently of Darwin’s. Now Matthias Kopfmüller’s team want to add to Wallace’s work: can the undersea evidence explain what Wallace found on land? What Wallace had recognised is that within a single island group there seemed to be a barrier that species could not pass.</desc>

    <title>War Crimes of the Liberators</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>US soldiers fought for democracy and the freedom of other nations. Yet in the course of military operations, they too committed war crimes. Most of them never followed up on let alone punished. In the wake of the Allies’ advance against Hitler’s tyranny, there were numerous atrocities committed by the victors, not only in the East. Apart from their medals, some American soldiers also kept a dark secret. GIs killed German Prisoners of War and raped thousands of German women. Estimates of the number of German victims vary widely, and are highly disputed among experts. Not least because they touch on a taboo, since for decades in Germany the subject had been considered as a potential strain on the relation between the Federal Republic of Germany and its Western Allies. According to some historians there were several thousand sexual assaults by American soldiers in Bavaria alone when US forces liberated the region in April 1945. At some invasion beaches in Normandy, only every second germen POW survived. Often, the liberators – shocked by the sight of German atrocities – would fall into a spiral of violence. Very few of these crimes came under investigation by US military courts. Studies by the US War Department hinting at a comparatively high number of transgressions were classified secret.</desc>

    <title>Crime Scene Eulau - The Mystery of the 13 Skeletons</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>This documentary focuses on a spectacular discovery made in a quarry near the village of Eulau, not far from the central German town of Naumburg. Neolithic graves contained the skeletons of three women, two men and eight children, buried tenderly 4500 years ago, some affectionately entwined. In 2008, for the first time anywhere in the world, it was possible to perform a DNA analysis on the earliest evidence of the existence of a nuclear family. This was a sensation - but why did these people all die at the same time? Were they the victims of a violent crime? Who were they, and how did this terrible drama unfold? Archaeologists insist that these victims will not be forgotten, since these days it is possible to do far more than simply date and record such finds. Modern scientific methods have revolutionised archaeology, enabling us to discover how and why the family from Eulau in the German state of Sachsen-Anhalt died 4500 years ago. By enlisting the help of a CID profiler, archaeologists and anthropologists employ state-of-the-art analytical methods to investigate this Stone Age crime. In the process we discover key information about an era before recorded history which has previously been shrouded in mystery - and astonishing information about the composition of the population here also comes to light. It seems that the third millennium before Christ saw two major waves of migration, from Eastern and Western Europe, which determine the composition of the population here. In the middle of what is now Germany these two migratory movements met. Could this be the background to the mysterious murders of Eulau?</desc>

    <desc>Throughout history, humans have surrounded themselves with animals. But there are two species that are our undeniable favourites. Every dog today was once a wolf - genetically speaking. Wolves and hominids met as early as 400,000 years ago. Ancient hunter-gatherers and wolves competed for the same prey, and used the same tracking techniques.</desc>

    <desc>Most school textbooks continue to recite the conventional wisdom that Europe does not have any deserts. They are out of date. Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece are four EU countries that are already so badly affected that they have joined the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD).</desc>

    <desc>Although nine disastrous plagues had already devastated the land along the Nile, Pharaoh remained stubborn and would not release Moses and his people from slavery. And so their God, Yahweh, planned his final assault: At midnight, he sent death over Egypt – all the firstborn, Man or beats, had to die … there was no escape.</desc>

    <title>War Crimes of the Liberators</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>US soldiers fought for democracy and the freedom of other nations. Yet in the course of military operations, they too committed war crimes. Most of them never followed up on let alone punished. In the wake of the Allies’ advance against Hitler’s tyranny, there were numerous atrocities committed by the victors, not only in the East. Apart from their medals, some American soldiers also kept a dark secret. GIs killed German Prisoners of War and raped thousands of German women. Estimates of the number of German victims vary widely, and are highly disputed among experts. Not least because they touch on a taboo, since for decades in Germany the subject had been considered as a potential strain on the relation between the Federal Republic of Germany and its Western Allies. According to some historians there were several thousand sexual assaults by American soldiers in Bavaria alone when US forces liberated the region in April 1945. At some invasion beaches in Normandy, only every second germen POW survived. Often, the liberators – shocked by the sight of German atrocities – would fall into a spiral of violence. Very few of these crimes came under investigation by US military courts. Studies by the US War Department hinting at a comparatively high number of transgressions were classified secret.</desc>
