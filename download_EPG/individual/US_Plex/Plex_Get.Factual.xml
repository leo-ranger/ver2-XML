    <title>The Antarctica Challenge - A Global Warning</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Filmmaker Mark Terry leads an expedition to Antarctica to report on the new discoveries made by the world’s scientific community stationed in Antarctica during International Polar Years (March, 2007 to March, 2009). This award-winning documentary will provide support interviews from polar experts and research scientists around the world as well as rare footage of wildlife. It reveals many startling new scientific revelations such as penguin suicide, new vegetation growing in the world’s largest desert, diminishing populations of land animals and marine life and the dangerously increasing melting of Antarctica’s land ice. These new discoveries were considered so valuable that this film became the only one invited by the United Nations tom screen to world leaders during the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, December, 2009.</desc>

    <title>Expedition to Eternal Ice</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>In the spring of 1930, when Alfred Wegener sets off on his third Greenland expedition, he hopes it will be the crowning glory of his career. Just a few years earlier he created a furore when he published his theory of continental drift; now he intends to revolutionise climatic research. For a whole year he and his team will compile data from high in the atmosphere and deep in the ice sheet. This is to be the first long-term climatic study ever carried out, and it marks the beginning of modern climatic research. Some of the scientists will venture far into the interior of the country and even set up a research station on the ice. This, the aptly named Inland Ice, will be 400 km away from the base camp on the West Coast, and specially constructed motorised propeller sleds will be used to transport not only the construction materials for the station but also provisions to see them through the long winter. Wegener has planned the expedition meticulously, down to the tiniest detail – but things don't turn out as he hoped. Right at the start the weather upsets his calculations. He loses six valuable weeks, and it then emerges that the propeller sleds don't work properly. They will have to resort to dog sleds for all their transportation needs. Despite the unfavourable circumstances, the scientists begin work in the middle of the ice sheet… even though they don't have enough provisions for the winter. Supplies are to be brought out to them later, but then the weather takes a dramatic turn for the worse, and Alfred Wegener and his men are faced with a race against time, their very lives at stake. A race they will ultimately lose.</desc>

    <desc>Sperm whales in the Mediterranean? Is the most popular holiday spot for Germans really home to the biggest predator on our planet? It is common knowledge that sperm whales like to hunt in the shallow waters of the ocean, but wildlife film-maker Thomas Behrend gets plenty of sceptical looks when he sets off for Greece with his camera in order to film sperm whales.</desc>

    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>The first woman who made history in Western civilization, who believed she had a divine mission and saved France during the dark days of the Hundred Years War, was a girl from a simple background who defied all the institutions of the day. Her victories enabled the dauphin to be crowned Charles VII of France in the cathedral at Reims, but in the end she was charged with heresy and burned at the stake... still just 19 years of age.</desc>

    <desc>Unlike the other women in this series, Sophie Scholl had neither power nor influence. She has gone down in history because she took a stand against injustice, virtually ignored by the world at large, and paid the ultimate price for her principles. Alongside Count von Stauffenberg, she is now one of the most popular figures of German resistance against Hitler during the Second World War.</desc>

    <title>The Antarctica Challenge - A Global Warning</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Filmmaker Mark Terry leads an expedition to Antarctica to report on the new discoveries made by the world’s scientific community stationed in Antarctica during International Polar Years (March, 2007 to March, 2009). This award-winning documentary will provide support interviews from polar experts and research scientists around the world as well as rare footage of wildlife. It reveals many startling new scientific revelations such as penguin suicide, new vegetation growing in the world’s largest desert, diminishing populations of land animals and marine life and the dangerously increasing melting of Antarctica’s land ice. These new discoveries were considered so valuable that this film became the only one invited by the United Nations tom screen to world leaders during the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, December, 2009.</desc>

    <title>Expedition to Eternal Ice</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>In the spring of 1930, when Alfred Wegener sets off on his third Greenland expedition, he hopes it will be the crowning glory of his career. Just a few years earlier he created a furore when he published his theory of continental drift; now he intends to revolutionise climatic research. For a whole year he and his team will compile data from high in the atmosphere and deep in the ice sheet. This is to be the first long-term climatic study ever carried out, and it marks the beginning of modern climatic research. Some of the scientists will venture far into the interior of the country and even set up a research station on the ice. This, the aptly named Inland Ice, will be 400 km away from the base camp on the West Coast, and specially constructed motorised propeller sleds will be used to transport not only the construction materials for the station but also provisions to see them through the long winter. Wegener has planned the expedition meticulously, down to the tiniest detail – but things don't turn out as he hoped. Right at the start the weather upsets his calculations. He loses six valuable weeks, and it then emerges that the propeller sleds don't work properly. They will have to resort to dog sleds for all their transportation needs. Despite the unfavourable circumstances, the scientists begin work in the middle of the ice sheet… even though they don't have enough provisions for the winter. Supplies are to be brought out to them later, but then the weather takes a dramatic turn for the worse, and Alfred Wegener and his men are faced with a race against time, their very lives at stake. A race they will ultimately lose.</desc>
