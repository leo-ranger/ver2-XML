    <title>The Secret File of Marco Polo</title>
    <category>Movie</category>
    <desc>Did Marco Polo, the most illustrious traveller in history, ever go to China? A dispute lingers to this day; with some scholars still doubting whether the Venetian’s book is a genuine personal account of China’s 13th-century Middle Kingdom and its marvels. Scientists, western scholars and Chinese historians have uncovered striking new proof that the son of Venetian merchants actually had been in China. We accompany them on their quest from Venice to Beijing, to Yangzhou and Quanzhou, from the gravestones of Italian merchant families to Chinese chronicles documenting the presence of one ‘Boluo’ at the imperial court, to famous buildings described by Marco Polo and to the ‘salt men’ of China who still apply the techniques that were used seven hundred years ago. This is a journey of opulent vistas, re-enacting Marco Polo’s experiences in 13th-century China and sheds light on the pivotal role, played by an obscure writer of chivalric novels, in producing the manuscript of the Travels of Marco Polo.</desc>
