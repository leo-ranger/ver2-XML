    <desc>Mark Peterson sets his sights on a Free-Range New Zealand Red Stag, but it doesn't come easy. Dense fog, steep terrain, and thick vegetation make finding a mature stag no easy task. Watch as Mark Peterson and his guide cover the gorgeous New Zealand landscape in search of one of the most sought-after big game animals on the South Island of New  - Zealand. On this hunt, Mark was unable to get his firearms import permit in time to take his Gunwerks rifle, so he'd again have to borrow from his guide.</desc>

    <desc>Hunting has a way of grounding us, reminding us of what truly matters: shared moments and unforgettable memories. Chance and Ashleigh Eckert are on their first out-of-state hunt in the rolling hills of Ohio. After overcoming a life-changing kidney transplant, their story is one of faith, love, and resilience. While the goal was a big buck, the true reward was the time spent together and the lessons learned along the way. Because hunting is about so much more than the harvest — it’s about the journey.</desc>

    <episode-num system="onscreen">S08E08</episode-num>
    <desc>There’s nothing like a change in weather conditions to wreck a perfectly good fishing plan, and that’s exactly what Capt. Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc>
