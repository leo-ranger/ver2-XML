    <desc>The highs and lows of fishing teach us to ride the wave, and the captains, mates, and everyday Costa Rican citizens have a phrase for such a mindset – “Pura Vida.” Those two words are more of a cultural ethos than a casual expression, and a reminder to remain smiling, thankful, and to never sweat the small stuff. - For the crews and anglers of Los Sueños, the good days far outweigh the bad. Nestled inside a small nook of Playa Herradura, Costa Rica’s Los Sueños Resort and Marina serves as a luxury embarkation point for some of the world’s most heralded bluewater fishing. Many places tout similar claims, but numbers don’t lie: It is common for a single boat to release over a dozen marlin in a single day, and the area holds perhaps the largest concentrations of big Pacific sailfish anywhere.</desc>
