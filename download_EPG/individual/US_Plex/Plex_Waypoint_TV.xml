    <episode-num system="onscreen">S01E04</episode-num>
    <desc>New. York. City. That’s where our host Josh Rosen kicks off his journey in Episode 4—and where he lived for 16 years and started up the surf-centric apparel brand, Saturdays NYC. Back in his old stomping grounds, Josh first meets up with the award-winning chef and Mumbai native, Chintan Pandya, currently blowing up the New York food scene with his unapologetic and authentic Indian cuisine (pro tip: try the goat brains). Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street. As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc>

His team at One Call Concepts supported Marks idea of delivering The Call 811, the national call before you dig number and safe digging message, to the outdoor viewer thru outdoor TV a reality. It was Mark’s dream as a kit to host an outdoor show.   - Jimmy and his team took a risk that the show would take off and it did.  Now airing on multiple outdoor networks and digital distribution platforms, Jimmy’s belief and Mark’s crazy dream has taken the safe digging message to tens of millions of viewers over the last 9 years.  Listen to these two reminisce on past fishing trips and watch as they go to one of Mark’s favorite fishing lakes in KY for some crazy fall largemouth bass fishing action!</desc>
