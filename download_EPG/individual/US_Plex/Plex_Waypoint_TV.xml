    <desc>Illinois isn’t the first state you think about when it comes to waterfowl, but the Wentz Brothers have dialed in some honey holes over the years. On this episode, a slew of waterfowl experts put to the test some of the newest Winchester waterfowl ammunition during the great migration of the Mississippi Flyway in early December. We’ll also head north to the shores of Kodiak Island, Alaska with Chris and Casey Keefer as they push the limits of Winchester’s new Last Call Double Shot on fast-ripping sea ducks. - GUESTS: Zach Wentz (Team Winchester) Nathan Robinson (Winchester Ammunition) Ryan Swaner (Winchester Repeating Arms) Chris Jennings (Ducks Unlimited) Mike Brasher (Ducks Unlimited) Scott Olmsted (American Hunter) Travis Hall (Field &amp; Stream) Chris Keefer (Team Winchester) Casey Keefer (Team Winchester)</desc>

    <desc>This week we join professional angler, Andrew Nordbye, for a cold day on Guntersville to catch some giant crappie; traveling through a major winter storm and arriving at an abandoned lake was the not-surprising scene for the day. Andrew's priorities are in order when it comes to his marriage, his faith, and his family, including just-arrived new babies...but he sill made time to squeeze in this day on water with us!</desc>

    <desc>This week, we reflect on a tragic and sad memory in our lives as we remember a dear childhood friend of my son Nick, Nathan Wimsatt. Our families have been close for man years and shared a lot of time together around the soccer field, vacations, fishing trips, and much more. Nathan passed in a tragic car accident at only 18 years on April 29th, 2023. This week his Dad Brian is joining me on Lake Taylorsville where we'll share some memories and celebrate Nathan's life...that ended way to soon!</desc>
