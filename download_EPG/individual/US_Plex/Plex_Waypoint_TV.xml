    <desc>The boys are back in the Florida Keys to kick off the new season. Ali gets to check out Rush's new digs at the Ocean's Edge Resort and take a ride on the new, Mercury powered SeaVee 34Oz. Rush has been dialing in his new live bait set up and has a few freshies to hopefully feed to a hungry wahoo. And if that doesn't work, there's always something great to catch in the Florida Keys.</desc>
