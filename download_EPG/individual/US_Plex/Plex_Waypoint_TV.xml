    <desc>This spring, Rivers are Life proudly partnered with The Little Forks Conservancy for a stream sampling event along Michigan’s Cedar River—a vital part of the watershed that eventually flows into Saginaw Bay. - Held on May 17 at the Gladwin Conservation District’s Community Garden, the event brought together Citizen Scientists from across the state. Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health. - Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river. - The results? Based on initial identifications, the Cedar River shows signs of excellent water quality—making it one of Michigan’s prized Blue Ribbon Trout Streams.</desc>

Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street.

    <desc>"Hope you're hungry. In this episode, come along as we eat our weight in sushi and ramen, meet nori farmers and wagyu ranchers, and make some new surfing buddies along the way. P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes. - In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc>
