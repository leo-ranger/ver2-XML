    <desc>We set out to tell the tale of Marion - and his legendary Mack’s Prairie Wings, smack dab in the middle of the world famous Stuttgart, Arkansas - the land of  ducks and rice. Get an inside look at a man that many consider to be larger than life, from those that knew him best, like his cousin and fellow hell raiser, Bud McCollum. We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings. It’s partners in business, and partners in potholes and it’s pure Arkansas...just like Marion.</desc>

Not many of us can say that, nor understand what that truly means. The things they've had to see, and the sacrifices they've made in their daily lives, can have a profound impact on them. Trinity Oaks' Bucks for the Brave platform allows the loved ones and communities that support these heroes to share their stories and unite us all in honoring and recognizing their service to our great nation. We are proud to continue to be a part of this incredible program, getting these heroes in the outdoors for the hunt of a lifetime.</desc>
