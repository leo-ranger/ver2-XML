    <desc>We are blessed for the opportunity to follow along the guys from Trinity Oaks for Bucks for the Brave. The men and women that served in  our armed services and as first responders, had jobs that required the, to be willing to sacrifice their own lives every day, in order to protect or save someone else's. Not many of us can say that, nor understand what that truly means. The things they've had to see, and the sacrifices they've made in their daily lives, can have a profound impact on them. Trinity Oaks' Bucks for the Brave platform allows the loved ones and communities that support these heroes to share their stories and unite us all in honoring and recognizing their service to our great nation. We are proud to continue to be a part of this incredible program, getting these heroes in the outdoors for the hunt of a lifetime.</desc>
